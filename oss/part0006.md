CHAPTER 2

# THE PROBLEM WITH STRATEGIES

Over the last 20 years, I've been paid a lot to build big, beautiful strategies for my clients. When creating strategies, I'd leave no stone unturned. I would spend at least 40 (sometimes up to 80) hours researching and dissecting strengths, weaknesses and areas of opportunity. I would look at competitors, ideas for inspiration, ad budgets, messaging, branding and almost anything else you could imagine.

Over those two decades, I've received phenomenal feedback about my work. After a couple of years, it hit me that my strategy work never really helped my clients make the impact I hoped for.

I typically follow-up with my clients three months, six months, or even a year later. At the time, it was common to find out they were no longer following the plan. It left me discouraged, disheartened, and uncertain about why they veered off track.

It took me a couple of years, but I started asking questions. That is when I realized that just the thought of a 30-page strategy document felt burdensome and stressful, to say the least. The truth was, the whole thing felt complicated, over-engineered, and had more information than even an advanced marketer like me could handle. Looking back, those documents were filled with 50% fluff (and possibly more in some cases). Yes, there was a lot of value packed into the document for the client, but more than half of the information wouldn't help the client move in the most appropriate direction. I realized something had to change, but I didn't know what.

As we progressed, I managed to guide clients towards acknowledging the necessity for simplification. Initially, I deemed simplification as reducing from 30 to 15 pages. Over the next 18 months, progress seemed evident. Clients embraced their strategies and exhibited enhanced confidence in their future steps. Although receiving praise, I didn't witness the substantial transformation in their digital marketing or bottom line that I had anticipated.

I soon recognized two key issues. Firstly, the strategy had to be straightforward. After all, simplicity eliminates excuses. Secondly, there had to be a timeline or what I term as an execution plan, akin to having three implementation phases. Essentially, everyone requires clear instructions, much like assembling an Ikea desk. (And, incidentally, the finest instructions should be so simple that even a third-grader could follow them effortlessly.)

Fast forward a couple more years and I'm working in the agency world for a social media shop. I'm delivering an extensive workshop for the local chamber of commerce about generating social media results for small businesses. As usual, I’m working hard to create value for my audience while also trying to pack 47 slides into 45 minutes. Obviously, that’s not ideal.

I was tasked with adding slides on strategy, yet time was scarce for a deep dive. This prompted me to reflect on my strategy clients, and suddenly, a lightbulb went off. I began jotting down the key components of my strategy, condensing them into nine essentials. It formed the basis for a simple spreadsheet, which I captured in a screenshot and placed on a slide. Alongside it, I penned a brief text: "A strategy so easy, there's no excuse not to use it." This moment marked the cornerstone of my approach in the digital marketing world.

If you haven’t put two and two together, this was a turning point in my young marketing career. Not only did I receive a lot of great feedback, but everyone in the workshop asked for a copy of the strategy. Even more enlightening was that the theory of simplifying their strategy became sticky, not just with my audience but also with me. I began sharing this strategy more often in my speaking engagements and it took on a life of its own. Honestly, it’s really what became the catapult for this book.

What I’m getting at is, you’ve been making this more complicated than it is. It all comes down to this: you need to simplify your marketing. In other words, make your marketing so easy; you have no excuses.

The Light Switch Theory

I know someone who manages a family-owned golf business in Minnesota, where the summers are stunning but brief, lasting only about four months. However, the winter's extend for about six months. Unlike our counterparts in warmer regions, our behaviors shift with the changing seasons. For instance, during fall and winter, people engage in activities like bowling, skiing, ice fishing, hunting, and other indoor pursuits. If you operate a seasonal business in the Midwest, you're familiar with the lengthy off-seasons, often enduring months with minimal to no revenue.

Their situation resembles many others who run small family businesses. The predicament happens every year, and from the outside looking in, it’s quite unfortunate and predictable.

Here's the scenario. The golf course experiences a 20%-25% decline in revenue as October progresses, with another significant drop in November when the course closes for the season. Fortunately, they rely on end-of-year merchandise sales to clear inventory and maintain enough revenue to cover expenses. Then comes December, bringing cold weather and little interest in golf, except for a few who purchase gift certificates. As the business enters its six to eight-week offseason, some react with panic, initiating a large 40% off sale in hopes of a quick turnaround.

If you have a solid business, an annual fire sale will surely drum up some revenue. However, will your reactive marketing fire sale change anything in your business? I’d argue not. This happens a lot in small businesses, especially those that fight seasonality. So often a business owner thinks he or she can flip a switch and fix everything. Enter the light switch theory.

It's how many solopreneurs in small businesses manage their marketing. The theory is reactionary based on a need or, as I call it, reactionary marketing. Often, my clients come to me because they have what they consider an unexpected need. That unexpected need could be a vacancy of two roles caused by two current employees leaving in the coming weeks. So often, these clients think that posting a job application on their social media or LinkedIn will attract hundreds of qualified individuals. But the truth is, your application and your messaging are just white noise in a sea of sameness. This, my friends, is you trying to flip the switch or, as I call it, rely on reactionary marketing.

Alternatively, there's proactive marketing, which entails strategic planning. Allow me to illustrate with an example related to the hiring scenario I discussed earlier.

Many companies anticipate the need to hire periodically throughout the year. If this applies to your company, it's essential to recognize that activities such as team-building events, community engagement, employee spotlights, and celebrating small victories should all play a significant role in your social media strategy. These elements collectively convey the message that your company is an excellent place to work and emphasizes its vibrant culture beyond office walls. Regardless of the target audience, highlighting this aspect of your company can help differentiate and give you a competitive advantage amongst those hiring.

Whether you're looking to increase sales, attract more talent, or earn more donations for your nonprofit, you need to be proactive with your marketing if you’re going to expect any results.

Being reactive is the same as throwing things against the wall and hoping that something will stick; it’s also the same as a hope-and-pray strategy.

One of the biggest reasons why reactionary marketing rarely, if ever, works is that many times, when someone is new or first discovers your brand, the first thing they are likely to do is check out your profile pages to validate your business. They tend to dig through a handful of posts to determine your business's credibility, determining whether they will follow your page and engage with your content.

In the previous situation where the company was hiring, what if there was nothing on their social media page to support their company culture, its people-first initiative, diversity, community involvement, or the commitment to being carbon neutral by 2050? Well, that first impression will be nothing more than white noise. While your company may truly be award-winning for its culture, compensation and benefits, your followers and prospective applicants would have no idea. As a byproduct, you’ve made your company a commodity without a unique competitive advantage. So, why should I consider applying or leaving my job to join said business?

I talk a lot about proactive versus reactive marketing while simultaneously providing suggestions and it’s often met with deaf ears. Clients and prospects I've worked with usually say, "yeah, I tried that, and it didn't work,” or “we didn't have a lot of luck with TikTok.” Another one is, “I ran some ads but didn't get good results.” It's almost like they're making an excuse as to why it didn't work. It’s almost like it couldn't be something they're doing; it has to be the platform itself. But the truth is, all of these things work, and they work exceptionally well. I'd argue that most of these digital advertising tactics are cost-effective while simultaneously being rather inexpensive as compared to traditional marketing tactics.

But why do so many people say I tried it and it doesn't work? For starters, most small businesses, solopreneurs, and entrepreneurs need to be more strategic. They are reactive instead of proactive.

Over the next few chapters, I'll provide an extensive list outlining why your social media efforts or the different tactics you've employed might not have yielded the desired results. I'll thoroughly demystify and debunk each of these reasons. In fact, I'll simplify the process to the extent that you'll be eager to give these methods another shot. My aim is to make it incredibly straightforward, leaving you with no excuses for not achieving results.

Keep The Macro in Mind

At this early stage in the book I already feel like a broken record but when I say proactive marketing I'm explicitly talking about keeping the macro in mind. Planning a month in advance would give you a massive advantage over most small businesses. And, I'd be elated if you did that.

However, planning out your content calendar a month in advance is not exactly keeping the macro in mind. Being macro-focused requires you to plan several months in advance. As I've mentioned, and we'll talk about that more later on, most businesses have some level of seasonality. That could be weather-related, or even having revenue peaks and valleys due to holidays like Valentine's Day or Christmas.

For example, while most of us are not Amazon or Walmart, it is absolutely critical that our planning for Christmas takes place no later than September or October. As you can imagine, many families start their shopping for Christmas as soon as October and many have all of their shopping done before Thanksgiving.

So, what am I getting at here? If you're a small brick and mortar, retail business and you were doing your best to keep the macro in mind, you would have most, if not all, of your marketing prepared before the fourth and final quarter of the year. Specifically, you would have everything prepared, planned and much of it implemented before the end of September.

I know what you're thinking, that sounds preposterous and borderline crazy. And for those of you who have no plan and no strategy, it's likely to feel that way because doing any of this would be the exact opposite of what you're currently doing. Planning even a month in advance may seem like a monumental shift for your business.

When you're keeping the macro in mind, you're being strategic. This method allows you to salt and pepper in different content themes and narratives based on some of your business’s upcoming wants and needs. By doing this you can support an upcoming hiring campaign or, if you're a non-profit, maybe an upcoming capital campaign. We’ll jump into this later on.
