CHAPTER 4

# BUILDING YOUR RECIPE (SUBJECTIVELY AND OBJECTIVELY)

This is my favorite part of the book, and it is the framework for almost everything I do in business and life. It's also as much a philosophy as it is anything else. And it was the cornerstone of my first book. Don’t worry, that will make sense by the end of this book.

Interestingly, a recipe for marketing is similar to a recipe for a good pot of chili. In essence, if you travel the world, you'll encounter thousands of variations for chili, ranging from vegan to vegetarian, spicy to mild, with beans or without, and so on. What's beautiful is that none of these recipes are inherently right or wrong. However, they all hinge on a few key factors. Firstly, it's the ingredients you have in your proverbial pantry. Geography can also play a role, depending on the ingredients readily available in your region. Just as with cooking for kids, you'll cater to taste preferences, meaning your chili is less likely to be spicy. Additionally, consider the utensils you have available, as they could also significantly impact the outcome of your chili.

While there is no right or wrong answer, we know you will not get the desired outcome if you omit one or two ingredients in your recipe. Sure, the chili could be very much edible. However, it likely wasn't the target you set out for. And that often happens in marketing when we deviate from our plan or strategy.

I know, it's the secret sauce that everyone is after. However, it should be noted that the secret sauce is made from multiple ingredients. It's not just one thing. And by itself, the secret sauce doesn't make a monumental impact without all the other ingredients. The best example I could give you would be adding that secret sauce to a Big Mac. You might enjoy a Big Mac, but it's still just a generic fast food burger. Subjectively, that sauce might enhance the experience or the overall taste of the burger. However, it's not a gastropub or steakhouse burger that sells for $18. And even the secret sauce can't make that fancy cheeseburger taste much better if it isn't cooked correctly.

I want you to think less about a secret sauce. Believing that a single secret ingredient will lead to a significant jump in sales is not realistic. The truth is, there isn’t just one tactic. If you want the real secret, focus on strategy (the recipe) and implementation of your plan.

Let me be crystal clear. Your strategy is your recipe, or roadmap. A tactic is not a strategy and a strategy is not a tactic. Tactics are most of the activities we associate with marketing, typically implementation like creating content, posting, automating your social media responses, etc.

In my (not so secret anymore) recipe, there are 12 ingredients. Full disclosure, I will occasionally add or subtract a few ingredients (in cooking they are spices, in marketing they are tactics) that I feel may complement a chiropractic client and may be much less relevant to a pizzeria. Just like your home, I have well over 30+ seasonings in my pantry. I could use them all but as I’ve alluded to in previous chapters, not all seasonings and ingredients will benefit this recipe. Using more than what is required will be nothing more than wasted (inedible) food and money eaten up by the garbage disposal.

All of the ingredients are almost equal in terms of importance, just like the spokes on a bicycle wheel. If you aren't checking the box on all of these, it is doubtful you will get to the destination you plan to travel to. On the flip side, if you're just getting started, it may be unrealistic to begin doing all these things initially. But that doesn't make your recipe incorrect. You are doing the best you can to create a delicious meal with the ingredients you have. With time, you'll generate results, your business will grow, and hopefully, you'll have additional staff to supplement your marketing efforts. And when that time comes, there'll be no excuses not to check all 12 boxes.

Finally, just like cooking a magnificent pot of chili, which takes several hours, results with your marketing also require time and patience. Leveraging these 12 ingredients may not generate earth-shattering results in the first couple of weeks or even the first couple of months. As I've mentioned before, our goal is to create momentum by taking baby steps along the way. I'm looking for consistent growth in your output, engagement and more importantly, continuous growth with your metrics monthly.

Throughout the following chapters, this book will assist you in identifying which ingredients to include and which to avoid when creating your recipe for improved marketing. By completing the evaluations and homework provided in the book, you will gain a clearer understanding of your strengths and weaknesses, guiding you on where to begin. A pro tip is to concentrate on one or two categories at a time rather than attempting to address everything simultaneously.

Step #1 - Getting Started

I'm often asked what first step someone should take. The assumption is always that we need to dive in and start crafting our strategy. Well, you would be wrong if that is what you're thinking right now. The reason is that by creating a strategy without research, data, or competitive analysis, we would be making a plan that is 100% arbitrary. In other words, the whole thing would be nothing more than a large hypothesis or a big wish. You'd be taking actions without rhyme or reason and certainly without purpose. You'd be returning to that hamster wheel, taking action that likely won't have any impact.

So, what's the first step? The first step is to start with an audit. Unlike a tax audit, this should be a lot of fun. It should be a great experience because it is a tremendous opportunity to learn about your business, its marketing, the competition, and what's working and what's not. You'll walk away with a tremendous amount of creative inspiration. Let's dive in, shall we?

Why An Audit

In my years of marketing, I'm often surprised how often something so simple that I assume my clients should already be doing can be so enlightening and sometimes eye opening.  This has been historically true for all of my clients, large and small. I understand that sometimes we are so focused on working in our business that we don't have enough time to work on our business. Being caught in this sort of hamster wheel can be like running with blinders on - which is not always a bad thing.

However, at least once a year we need to zoom out a 360°, holistic look at our business, marketing, sales, customers, competitive landscape, trends, etc. This often gets overlooked. This process can be time intensive and for many of us it exposes the truth, which can be painful. And because many of us tend to be conflict avoidant, we tend to deviate away from the mistakes we've made, the things we've overlooked, and the things we could be doing better.

I will often put more time and energy into an audit than I will into a strategy. Can you guess why? Oftentimes the audit is the first project I work on with a client. This not only helps me as a service provider, but also helps the client tremendously. And guess what?  Many of the findings, content inspiration, and ideas often cascade into the strategy. The total document ends up being a bit of a recommendation, which eventually leads to a strategy and an implementation plan. Without it, you might as well throw that strategy into the trash. Let me share with you a few ideas as to why I think this is so important.

Strategic Alignment and Cohesion: An audit rigorously assesses the alignment between your business objectives and your marketing strategies, ensuring that every tactic is cohesively contributing to your overarching goals. This alignment is critical for driving unified efforts across departments.

Data-Driven Decision Making: By grounding the strategy in data extracted from the audit, businesses transition from intuition-based to data-driven decision making. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy of targeting, optimization of marketing mix, and allocation of resources.

Quantitative and Qualitative Insight Synergy: An advanced audit goes beyond mere numbers, integrating qualitative insights from customer feedback, social media sentiment analysis, and competitor content strategies. This holistic view fosters a deeper understanding of the market dynamics and consumer psyche.

Innovation Through Competitive Benchmarking: Detailed analysis of competitors and market leaders can reveal innovative practices and emerging technologies being adopted in the industry. This benchmarking can inspire businesses to adopt disruptive strategies, technologies, and methodologies to gain a competitive edge.

Predictive Analytics and Trend Forecasting: Utilizing historical data and current market analysis, an audit can employ predictive analytics to forecast future trends, enabling businesses to preemptively adapt their strategies and be at the forefront of market evolutions.

Optimization of Customer Journey: By mapping out and analyzing every touchpoint in the customer journey, audits can uncover friction points and opportunities for enhancement, leading to a more seamless and personalized customer experience.

Refinement of Value Proposition: Audits can lead to a refined understanding of what truly differentiates a business in the eyes of its customers, allowing for sharper, more compelling value propositions that resonate deeply with the target audience.

Risk Management and Compliance: An often overlooked aspect is assessing regulatory compliance and potential risks in marketing practices. Audits can preemptively identify areas of vulnerability, from data privacy to advertising standards, ensuring that strategies are not only effective but also ethically and legally sound.

Sustainability and Social Responsibility: With an increasing consumer focus on sustainability and corporate social responsibility, audits can evaluate how these elements are integrated into marketing strategies, potentially identifying opportunities to align with these values more closely for greater brand loyalty.

By embracing these advanced perspectives, a marketing audit becomes not just a foundational step, but a transformative process that positions the business for strategic innovation, market leadership, and sustainable growth in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

Another way of looking at this is like taking your business and it’s digital marketing from a red ocean to a blue ocean. If you’re not familiar, I highly recommend you read the book Blue Ocean Strategy.

Integrating the strategic recommendations from the comprehensive marketing audit within the framework of the Blue Ocean Strategy creates a robust roadmap for businesses seeking to navigate from the fiercely competitive red oceans to the uncharted waters of blue oceans. By leveraging the deep insights, strategic alignment, and innovation opportunities unearthed through an audit, companies can identify and exploit the untapped markets and demand, as described in the Blue Ocean Strategy. The audit’s role in highlighting underexplored areas of consumer needs, competitive benchmarking, and digital trends aligns perfectly with the strategy’s core objective of creating new spaces (blue oceans) where competition is irrelevant.

Regardless of how successful your marketing may be, most of us need a strategic pivot. When underpinned by the insights from a 360 degree audit, businesses can break away from the red ocean of cutthroat competition and chart a course towards growth and differentiation in their own blue ocean, where they can thrive unchallenged and create new demand.

Create Your Audit

While I firmly believe your strategy needs to be as simple and easy as possible, audits are a bit different. Yes, it should be simple in many regards, but it's generally not a short document - and it's not short for several reasons. First, it should take a deep look at every aspect of your digital marketing footprint and each one of those areas should have its own page or two. It also takes a good hard look at a minimum of three competitors in your marketplace. I'll create a page that analyzes both their social media and their websites.

While the document itself is quite long (eleven sections or more) and filled with screenshots, I tried to keep my written findings and opinions as short as possible.  Many times we can make our point with just a few bullet points. The format is not as important as actually going through each step thoroughly. You're free to copy the document I created in Canva; However, I'd encourage you to make your own as you may feel the need to dive deeper into some areas as opposed to others. Now, let's take a look at the components of an audit

Audit Section #1 - Project Overview

As basic as it sounds, it's important to draft one to three short paragraphs about what this document is, why you're doing it, and how it should be utilized. It's important because there is likely going to be other stakeholders not in the marketing department who will read this. These stakeholders could be owners, upper management or another department that could have influence on budget, resources, and future decision making. The more thorough you can be with this the more likely it is that you will have created influence with your constituents. It also serves as a great reminder for you why you are investing the time and effort into creating this audit.

Audit Section #2 - Current Reputation (at a glance)

I often refer to this as the scroll test or the eyeball test. Before I dive deep into any one thing, I will glance over an organization's website, social media, Google business profile, and any other visible profiles or media I can find online. Without doing a lot of reading I scan the content as if I was a prospective buyer. When I do this, I always ask myself, “What do I see, what do I think, how do I feel?” Is there a feeling of trust, are they focused on making a sale or building a relationship? Do they take the time to educate visitors by answering questions before I ask them?  Is there proof they are not a fly by night company? Are they responding to comments, questions, and reviews? Ultimately, what is the vibe of their company and their brand putting off to the world? Oftentimes when you're working within an organization it is hard to step outside of that and answer this question objectively.

If you plan on auditing your own business, or maybe you are a marketing manager auditing your own work, it's important that you look outside of your organization and seek help for this step. This part of the audit is very much subjective. It is important you seek feedback from at least three different stakeholders and preferably those with some marketing or entrepreneurial knowledge.

Audit Section #3 - Brand Guidelines

For marketing professionals, this page is very much captain obvious. However, it's important to include the company logo, the brand colors, as well as the company voice or tone.  Oftentimes, this serves as a reminder that we need to be creating content that aligns with our branding, brand guidelines and its messaging.  In today's hectic business world, it's far too easy to get distracted and lose sight of what our brand stands for. The other part of this that's really important is to scan your content to interpret what the messaging currently is and ask yourself does this align with our company voice or tone.

When marketers refer to a company's "voice" or "tone," they're talking about the distinct personality and style conveyed through the company's communications and messaging. Here's a breakdown of the two:

Voice: This is the consistent personality or character of the brand, which is expressed across all content and communication channels. The voice reflects the brand's values, personality, and the way it views the world. It's what makes a brand recognizable and unique, regardless of the platform or medium. For example, a brand like Nike might have a motivational, inspiring voice that reflects its "Just Do It" ethos.

Tone: On the other hand, is more about the mood or emotional character of a specific piece of content, which can vary depending on the context, audience, and message. While the voice remains consistent, the tone can shift to suit the situation. For example, a company's tone might be more formal and respectful when addressing a customer service issue, but playful and casual when announcing a new, fun product feature on social media.

Together, voice and tone are crucial for crafting a brand's identity and for making sure its communications are coherent, relatable, and effective at engaging the intended audience. They help to humanize the brand, making it more accessible and appealing to consumers.

One thing we’ll dive deep into is the subject of content, specifically in section two. However, I think it’s critical to share this visual with you to help you start thinking about your company voice and how the content you produce can influence that, or vice versa.

Recalling the image of the individual in casual attire versus the same person in formal wear, clean-shaven with a styled haircut, serves as a powerful illustration of the significance of your company's voice and the impact of your content.

Audit Section #4 - Competitor Analysis

When I'm working with clients I'll ask them to create a short list of competitors. As a caveat, I use the word competitors loosely. These could be similar organizations located locally, regionally, or nationally. They could also be non-competitors that offer some overlap with your product or service regardless of location. Oftentimes, I'll consider only three and typically those that have a pretty good digital footprint.  It's not worth your time to consider an organization that does a poor job of marketing because it will be a colossal waste of your time. If you're looking for a way to benchmark, compare, or draw creative inspiration, we need to look at businesses that are successful and thriving. If you're not 100% sure who you should be looking at, do some research on Facebook or Google to find a few options. And don't be that person who tries to telli me that you don't have competitors- it's just not true.

My usual approach involves first examining a competitor's Facebook and Instagram profiles. If these platforms are not available, I explore their most frequently used social media profiles instead. During this analysis, I focus on identifying high-performing posts with elevated engagement rates, potential ideas that my team could repurpose in a unique manner, and emerging trends within the industry. Whenever I encounter particularly noteworthy or creatively inspiring content, I capture a screenshot for reference. Typically, I aim to gather a sample size of 4 to 6 posts for thorough evaluation and consideration.

I may also look at their content themes and types of content being leveraged. For example, are they utilizing story posts or vertical video and if so, what seems to be performing well?  This type of competitor analysis shouldn't take more than 10 to 15 minutes per business. Generally, I find myself not having to go back more than 20 to 30 posts to get all the intel I need.

Now, repeat the process with your next two competitors.

Audit Section #5 - Your Social Media

When I perform this service for my clients, I tend to spend a little more time on their social media pages and a lot less on the competitors.  Looking at competitors helps us gauge where overall marketing stacks up in the competitive landscape. I want to be clear that I don't want you or my clients looking over their shoulder consistently at the competition.

My first step here is to identify the top three or four performing posts and the top three or four bottom performing posts. I'm specifically looking at total engagement, which includes likes, comments, and shares. Because algorithms and trends change so frequently, I would encourage you to go back no more than four months to a year.

If you’re wondering how to calculate engagement rates, you can do this by dividing total measured engagements by total measured impressions, multiplied by 100. However, don't be alarmed if your engagement rates are in the low single digits, or even below 1%. That is the current state of social media on many platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Linkedin. We'll talk more about that later.

With that information, let's draw some conclusions as to what content themes and content types perform the best.

Absolutely, understanding your audience demographics is crucial for crafting content that resonates with them. Let's delve into the analytics tab on a social media platform to identify key insights about our audience, such as age, gender, location, and any other relevant details.

Once we have a clear picture of who our audience is, we can tailor our content to meet their preferences, interests, and needs effectively. This ensures that our content not only reaches the right people but also engages and connects with them on a deeper level, fostering stronger relationships and driving desired outcomes.

Audit Section #6 - Social Media Trends Page

I'd like you to pinpoint five or six trends, presenting them in bullet points only. Each main bullet point can include sub-bullets if needed. These trends may range from positive to negative, but should offer insights not immediately obvious to all stakeholders. Keep in mind that these trends will form the basis of future recommendations, ultimately shaping our strategy.

Audit Section #7 - Start, Stop, Continue

Throughout this document, you'll encounter a 'Stop, Start, Continue' page multiple times. This section serves as secondary recommendations to the overall document, emphasizing areas of strength, weakness, and opportunity. While identifying areas of weakness may be challenging, it proves exceptionally valuable. Redirecting our efforts towards tactics that better support our marketing endeavors can lead to greater success and less frustration in the long run.

For each of the three sections, it's important that we be honest with ourselves when looking at all aspects of our social media marketing. I'm trying to identify a minimum of two to three bullet points, max of six for each section.

In each of the three sections, it's crucial to maintain honesty while assessing every facet of our social media marketing. I aim to outline a minimum of two to three bullet points, with a maximum of six for each section. It's important to remain truthful across all three sections. Please stick to bullet points and keep them concise.

Audit Section #8 - Website Analysis

This one is a little easier and less time-consuming.  You're welcome to use third party tools to scan your competitors’ websites for website speed, health, search engine optimization, and keywords. However, I'm going to suggest that it be left only to the most advanced marketers reading this book. Many of these factors are beyond our control and not easily leveraged in our marketing strategy. While keyword research could be advantageous for your organization, unless you're proficient in SEO, it's challenging to utilize this intelligence effectively. When I'm going through the scroll test of each website, I focus on several aspects for analysis, including:

Imagery/Videos: The first thing we tend to notice are visuals, such as photos, graphics, and videos. As you've read this book you already know the importance of high quality imagery and that you'll want to avoid stock photography. However, a lot can be gained by observing how others are using visual content on their website to influence their visitors and their potential actions. Often, I'm looking at the quality of the visuals, the messaging within the content, and how it makes me feel as a visitor. I say that because if the content can evict a feeling or emotion, it is more probable that an individual will take action.

Upon scrolling through several pages and reading content, I consistently evaluate my emotional response. I inquire whether the website evokes feelings of trust, friendliness, compassion, professionalism, etc. What vibe do you get? Would it influence you to spend more time on the website or send an inquiry? Would it encourage you to come back or download the free lead magnet? This is crucial because our content and website form the initial impression, and it's vital to evoke a positive feeling or emotion within the first three to four seconds. Otherwise, visitors are likely to leave without taking action.

Speed: It’s often underestimated, yet it can have significant influence on website ranking and user engagement duration. However, the incorporation of videos can sometimes hinder loading speed, impacting both the website and specific pages.

Responsiveness: As shocking as this may be, not all websites are mobile friendly. More importantly, they are not responsive. This is a term that refers to a website's ability to adapt to various screen sizes. Although more than 80% of the world's website traffic comes from mobile devices, don't forget that desktops, laptops and tablets are still a substantial part of the electronic landscape and will be for many years. Because of all the different devices and screen sizes that exist, a website needs to be responsive so that it can adapt to various devices. An outdated website is going to require a lot more work for the user to properly view your website. Well this may not be as important when looking at competitors, it is important when analyzing your own website.

Headlines/Page Titles: This is one that gets overlooked by a lot of folks. It's not as much that you have it wrong, it's more about thinking outside the box. Consider this perspective: Most people aren't eager to read a section titled "History" on a website. However, they might be more intrigued by a title like "Our Journey." The same thing can be said about your mission, vision, and values. If it's something that's really important to you, you should be able to recite it. If you can't, then it's really not that important and likely doesn't need to be on your website. As an alternative, you can create a section that says “Why We Are Different,” or, “Why We Exist.” The difference here is that these headlines or titles are different. It's also helpful when they can be bold and/or thought-provoking. Choosing all the same boring page titles and headlines that everyone else is using only makes you blend in with all the other white noise that exists in today's world.

Keep in mind that page titles and headlines should be keyword rich. In other words, there should be verbiage that is relative to the information on the page. In full disclosure, it is challenging to do this on every page. However, it's important because you can help improve your search engine rankings.

CTA’s: Getting people to take action on your website is important but not always as easy as it sounds. Oftentimes, we have to help our website visitors along the journey by guiding them from page to page, ultimately encouraging them to subscribe to our newsletter, purchase something, or download our free eBook. We do that with a call to action button or a hyperlink in the text. As much as it seems like a very simple concept, there are a wide variety of ways we can get people to take action and sometimes we need to look outside of what we are doing for fresh ideas.  If you don't find anything worth documenting, then don't mention it.

Navigation: Whether I'm looking at my site or a competitor, I'm always looking for ease of navigation. Having nine tabs at the top of your website with an endless amount of drop-downs is not only confusing, but it can be overwhelming. What's worse is that that feeling leads to people quickly leaving your website. It's important that your main navigation includes only the most important tabs or landing pages of your website. However, the navigation is also seen in the footer of a website.

Indeed, secondary pages like a careers or portfolio page could be effectively utilized in that section. By reimagining their purpose and integrating them into the main navigation or homepage section, they become more prominent and accessible to visitors, potentially enhancing engagement and conversion opportunities.

There are a few other things you may want to consider that are ultimately only relevant to your brand and your website. I'm going to put them in bullet points and hopefully you can check the boxes on all of these things to ensure you're providing your website visitors a solid experience.

●        Consistency of fonts (Leverage 2-3)

●        Leveraging brand colors (2-4 max)

●        Social media links

●        Email subscribe form

●        Updated contact information

●        Social proof

●        Concise text

When you're going through this exercise, it's important to look at the three competitor websites before looking at your own. Doing so will help you objectively see whether you are trying to compete with your competitors or if you are on the verge of standing out in a blue ocean.

As you wrap this up, put all of this into a Stop, Start, Continue page.

Website Performance: Much of what I've previously explained relates to how the user interprets your business based on your website. This section is focused more on how the search engines view the health and performance of your website. It also has a lot to do with how and where your website gets ranked for various keywords and search phrases.

Speed: As I've mentioned before, website speed is an important factor for both users and search engines. In fact, my research indicates that it is among the top five most important ranking factors as it relates to SEO.

Slow websites are a turn-off for users, and most search engines recognize this fact. It's crucial to gauge the speed of your website on both mobile and desktop devices. I utilize a free tool called Google PageSpeed Insights for this purpose. This can be found by navigating to pagespeed.web.dev. Simply include your URL, click analyze, and in a matter of a minute or less you'll have a complete analysis of how your website performs on a scale of 0 - 100. The site will also include what it analyzes and what elements are preventing your site from performing better.

Honestly, I've seen websites rank anywhere from as low as 15 to as high as 100. I’ve set a minimum benchmark of 75 for my clients. Ideally, we aim for a website to rank in the eighties or higher. Achieving these speed ratings often leads to better search results and improved user experiences.

Website Health: Another excellent method to gain insights into the overall health and performance of your website is by conducting an SEO scan. There are numerous tools available for this purpose, many of which require a paid subscription. However, one tool I personally use and recommend is WebFX. Their tool can be accessed at webfx.com/seo-checker. While it does require some personal information, at the time of writing this book, it is free to use.

What's great about this tool is its comprehensive analysis. It covers security, performance, branding, backlinks, traffic, and social profiles. Additionally, it provides insights into the impact each of these factors has on the performance and ranking of your website. This level of detail is invaluable for optimizing your site and improving its overall effectiveness. If you're new to this it might be a little overwhelming, but I can promise you they'll break it down in a fairly simple fashion.

Some of the information it provides can be leveraged immediately as it relates to making small adjustments or improvements to your site. However, many of the areas in need of improvement will need to be made by a web developer or agency. Some aspects, like SEO, are a bit too advanced to experiment with.

What I'd suggest is capturing screenshots of the elements you deem most significant and incorporating a couple of them into your audit. Additionally, I recommend downloading a comprehensive report of the website scan. This will be valuable to share with the individual or company responsible for managing your website, providing them with detailed insights for improvement.

Full disclosure, there is a lot of information here so try not to overwhelm yourself with things that may not be as relevant

I don't expect most marketers reading this book to be able to take the information they received from these tools and be able to make the necessary changes. If you're not a website developer or an SEO expert, I'd recommend bringing this information to the person or agency who built your website and ask for assistance in making the necessary changes and updates to ensure that your website is performing properly and ranking better.

Audit Section #9 - Review Platforms

This one may or may not be relevant to all businesses and industries. If it's not, then it's not worth including in this document. However, if it is relevant and you don't have a profile on Google, Yelp, or Trip Advisor, then it's worth looking at at least a few competitors to understand how your business could be taking advantage of these tools to reach a broader audience.

When I look at these platforms, personally I want to know if a business is responding to reviews. Not doing so tells me they don't really care about what the customer thinks. Or doing so with any sort of anger or attitude tells me they don't take ownership when they make a mistake. This can be a big turnoff for prospective clients. A lot of people will use these platforms to make sure your business is open when they might be visiting. Either way, don't get caught looking out dated.  If you're a restaurant, salon, or boutique, it's important to have recent photos and videos that represent the products or services your business sells.  Looking out of date can be a good way not to get that potential phone call or email from a prospective customer.

These tools play a role in helping potential customers gauge the professionalism and accuracy of the services offered by a business. While some rely on customer reviews, others seek essential information such as address, hours of operation, and photos of the premises or products. These profiles are instrumental in enhancing online visibility and have been proven to boost website traffic, increase phone inquiries, and ultimately drive more business for small enterprises like yours.

Audit Section #10 - Google Analytics

When talking about analytics it's easy to get paralysis by analysis. If you're not accustomed to reviewing data, many of these points may seem irrelevant. That's why it's important to focus solely on metrics relevant to your business and its goals. By understanding the type of traffic your website currently attracts and envisioning where you want it to be in the future, you can establish solid goals and avoid getting lost in unnecessary details.

Focusing only on key metrics in Google Analytics can give small businesses valuable insights into their online performance without overwhelming them with data. Here are five essential metrics to prioritize and why they matter:

Traffic Sources: Understanding where your visitors are coming from (e.g., organic search, social media, direct visits, referral sites) helps you identify which marketing efforts are paying off. It allows you to allocate your resources more effectively, focusing on channels that drive the most valuable traffic to your site.

User Engagement (Pageviews, Average Time on Page): This metric gives you an idea of how engaging your content is. If visitors are spending a good amount of time on your pages and viewing multiple pages, it's a sign that your content is relevant and interesting to your audience. It can also highlight areas for improvement if the numbers are lower than expected.

Conversion Rates: Perhaps the most critical metric, conversion rates tell you the percentage of visitors who are taking a desired action on your site, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or filling out a contact form. High conversion rates indicate that your website is effective at compelling visitors to take action, which is directly tied to your bottom line.

Bounce Rate: Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your site after viewing only one page. A high bounce rate can indicate that your landing pages are not relevant or engaging enough to encourage further exploration. Reducing your bounce rate can lead to higher engagement and more conversions.

Mobile Traffic: With the increasing use of mobile devices to access the internet, monitoring your mobile traffic helps you understand how many of your visitors are coming from mobile devices and how well your site performs on these devices. If a significant portion of your audience are mobile users but your site isn't optimized for mobile, you could be missing out on valuable engagement and conversions.

When you’re all done, create a Stop Start Continue page.

Audit Section #11 - Recommendations

All of your time and effort leads you to this page. It's important for a lot of reasons and mostly because it will dictate everything we do from here on out. However, before you go and get yourself too excited about all of the new creativity and ideas you've developed through this process, I want you to try to rank your new ideas and objectives. More importantly, I want you to rank them by level of importance.

For a moment, I want you to take your marketing hat off and imagine you are the CEO. I want you to look at all the work that needs to be done. Consider the company's goals and objectives, and strategize how the marketing department can effectively facilitate progress from point A to point B, and onward to point C, and beyond. This entails aligning marketing efforts with broader business objectives, ensuring a cohesive approach to achieving success at each stage of the journey. What are the first three things you would do in the next 30 to 45 days? Well, this answer is going to be different for everyone.  It is probable that these things are going to be your heaviest lift. They are likely going to be a bit challenging, but as a result they are likely to be the most beneficial to your organization and the direction it is headed. Looking at the next three to six months, I want you to break down all your tasks into three phases. As you do that, create a timeline for when these phases start and when you hope to have all tasks completed. Some initiatives may require a fourth phase, while others may necessitate a longer runway, possibly extending close to a year. Ultimately, these decisions hinge on factors such as available bandwidth, budget constraints, team size, and other resources. Assessing these variables allows for tailored planning and execution, ensuring alignment with the company's capabilities and objectives.

Once you've achieved this, it's important to consult with your web developer to better understand what some of this is going to cost and how you're going to slot it into your budget. The beauty of outsourcing some of these tasks is that it allows you to focus more clearly on the  creation and implementation of your social media.

If you happen to lead a team or be part of a team that manages marketing you'll want to work closely with other stakeholders to ensure that your team is aligned with these recommendations and the phases at which things will be addressed.

I want to remind you that your audit and your strategy are two separate documents. Additionally, any time and effort invested into a strategy without a comprehensive audit is all going to be for nothing. It doesn't matter how long you've worked at a company or how good at marketing you may be. The content of this document serves as the foundational "why" behind every element included in your strategy. It provides the rationale and justification for each decision, ensuring that every aspect is purposeful and aligned with overarching objectives.

Let's pretend for a moment I was your leader. Without you investing time in this homework assignment, it would be difficult to articulate the current state of our digital marketing. Furthermore, you'd have a difficult time convincing me or your peers why you need additional resources or a larger advertising budget. It would be hard for me to support what it is you want to do because I don't know where we are currently at as a company in relation to our digital marketing performance. Now back to the strategy document.

Audit Step #2 – Bandwidth

Whether I’m conducting a digital marketing audit or coaching someone on how to conduct an audit, my first question is typically about bandwidth. Specifically, I want to know your bandwidth and the bandwidth of all marketing team members. Suppose five people occasionally help out with digital marketing. In that case, we need to know how much time is available for your marketing efforts. Why is this so important, you ask? This helps me, and should help you, craft a crystal clear vision. More importantly, it helps me understand how much higher we need to raise or lower the bar. I'll give you a more specific example.

Oftentimes, when talking to clients, they tell me they want to achieve X percent more sales or leads. Regardless of the KPI (key performance indicator), I can better understand if those goals are realistic based on the time (bandwidth) you dedicate to marketing. As I’ve previously stated, your goals should be predicated on historical data; they may also be based on other data points, including budget, bandwidth, resources, etc.

When considering your overall bandwidth, it's crucial to establish and identify a consistent amount of time that you and your team can dedicate on a weekly and monthly basis. Based on this allocation, implementing measures or checks and balances will help keep you accountable. If, at any point, your output falls below the time you're investing, your goals should also be adjusted accordingly. Time is precious in this context, so it's essential to allocate dedicated time for completing marketing tasks and, even more importantly, to safeguard that time on your calendars. We'll dive deeper into this topic in upcoming chapters.

Remember that we will have peaks and valleys in our schedule, some of which are caused by seasonality. In other words, there will be weeks or months where we have more time and in some cases, none. When determining the number of hours to dedicate, don't raise the bar too high and try to save ten hours. Find a number that you and your team feel is sustainable. You'd be surprised how well your strategy and content will perform even with as little as 2 hours per week.

Step #3 - Profile Analysis (Optimize Profile)

Now, it's time to be honest with yourself. I encourage my clients to review their social media profiles thoroughly.

Look at your content, specifically your best and worst-performing posts.

Look at your audience, the demographics, and the best times to post.

Believe it or not, that's just scratching the surface of what you should be reviewing. Ultimately, we're identifying trends, and whether you're an expert or a beginner, anybody can locate a couple of trends within ten to fifteen minutes. And guess what? These trends may look slightly different as we compare one social media platform to another.

Some of the other important aspects to consider include:

Optimized profiles: Are you filling out every square inch of your profile to maximize its effectiveness?

Providing valuable information: Are you offering prospects and followers information that keeps them engaged and encourages them to stay on your page?

Clear messaging: Are you effectively communicating what your company does and how it helps its clients?

Up-to-date contact information: Do you have current contact details and hours of operation readily available for your audience?

Now, you might look at that and say,” Well, Chris, that sounds elementary,”, and I know it is. However, as busy entrepreneurs, we often set and forget these things. When we do that, we almost always forget.

Just imagine for a moment that someone goes to your business page to find your phone number or hours of operation, only for that information to be incorrect. Not only will that leave a person upset and frustrated, but it could lead them to call and or visit your competitor instead. If we zoom out for a second, not only have you upset someone, but you've also given business to your competitor as a byproduct of not doing something so simple that it could’ve been completed in a minute or less.

Suppose you want the marketing audit to be robust, in-depth and intelligent. In that case, you should spend around 2-3 hours investigating your profiles, performance, audience and everything else.

One of the most overlooked parts of a marketing audit is the audience. I say that because most small business owners make assumptions about who follows their page and who they think their audience is. For example, I started my first small business back in 2017. It’s a party bike business called the Social Station. For those unfamiliar with that term, it’s essentially pedal tours through downtown where all bookings are made online.

It took well over a year to launch that business. I had assumed that my audience would be around 60% male and 40% female. As we got through the first six months of running the business, I started to dive in because I wanted to ensure that my $1,000 per month ad budget would perform as well as it could. We had grown our following to about 3,000 people within that time. It was not record-breaking but I felt good about it, considering we were in a town of less than 100,000 people. 68% of our followers were female, while 32% were male. Although this might not seem significant to some, it was a bit of a blow to the ego for someone with my experience in marketing. However, delving deeper, a noticeable trend emerged: there were significantly more female followers than male. Intrigued, I decided to gather customer data from our booking software. Initially, I assumed bookings would be evenly split between genders. Yet, of the first 100 bookings, 84 were made by women. That, my friends, was a big shock. While I've never claimed to have all the answers or be the most intelligent person in the room; I was pretty confident that my customer base would be somewhere in the ballpark of 50/50 regarding gender. I was wrong, but why was I wrong? I decided to consult with my wife and some of her female friends and there was a straightforward, yet very much overlooked, answer. Most of our customers are in their late 20s to late 40s, which is undoubtedly the married age. I was told that this trend shouldn't be a surprise to me. When I asked why, they all said it's because men don't plan s\*\*t. Instead, the wives make the majority of the plans in most relationships.

So, why am I telling you all of this? It doesn’t matter if you like the content you’re creating because you’re not the target audience. I quickly recognized I could continue creating content based on what I liked as a man or I could try to speak more to the female audience. I had to listen to my audience, ask questions, and continue looking at trends in terms of what type of content, themes, and narrative resonated most with those individuals. It was less about selling bookings, less about the drinking, and more about social aspects.

Some women shared with me that the experience was about creating memories, having fun, and breaking away from the typical visit to the bar with friends. After receiving this feedback, I doubled down on these aspects and began incorporating new trends and ideas that would further captivate and engage my prospective female audience.

I can't emphasize enough how many clients I've spoken with who believe they know their audience and clients, only to discover during a digital marketing audit that they are off the mark by as much as 20 to 40%. If you're wondering why your content isn't resonating with your audience, it's likely because you're addressing (and probably talking at) the wrong people.

When doing an audit, I look at analytics from a high-level. Before becoming a digital marketer, I never embraced or enjoyed looking at the numbers. Similar to many of you, I also experience the overwhelming, frustrating, and annoying feeling caused by the multitude of data points on all these platforms. Most of these data points are irrelevant to you, your business, and the future of your marketing. On the other hand, many of them have relevancy and could help if properly leveraged. Some data points can get so granular that paying attention to these details regularly will give you paralysis by analysis.

I focus on only three or four of the biggest, most important analytics. As we've discussed in this recipe philosophy, those three data points might be slightly different for me than for you. Paying attention to those analytics helps drive you toward success and achieving your goals. One important thing for me is looking at web traffic and how much comes from social media. I also want to know what other websites or outlets I am generating traffic from. Is it a local news outlet, chamber of commerce, online directory, or something else? We can identify trends when we look at web traffic, not what happened today but also what happened over the last 12-24 months. Reviewing web traffic will give us a better benchmark of what web traffic could and should look like in the coming weeks and months as we implement high-level strategies and tactics.

Reviews! Oh, where do I start on this subject? For those who need help understanding the importance, online reviews are one of the top three criteria that Google uses to gauge what customers think of your business. More specifically, they look at the number and quality of reviews as a way in which they should rank your website.

A good example would be comparing two local chiropractic businesses. Take Chiropractor A, which has three five-star reviews, and compare that to Chiropractor B, which has 75 reviews at an average rating of 3.7. One might think that the first chiropractic office with a perfect score would rank higher, but that's likely not the case. What Google sees is Chiropractor B has likely been established for several more years. They also see that they have more business because of more reviews. For the record, no business is immune to neutral or negative reviews.

What's essential for you to look at is what people say about your business, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent. We want to identify trends, and sometimes that is a very jagged pill for us entrepreneurs to swallow. However, people might be complaining about simple things that can easily be fixed, like the amount of time spent in the waiting room, cleanliness of the facility, friendliness of staff, etc., but what Google cares about is your responses to those reviews.

When I'm considering a new service like a chiropractor, tax specialist, or landscaper, I’ll go to Google and search for it. While I typically look at websites and social media, the best way to validate how easy and pleasant a business will be to work with is by spending a few minutes digging into their reviews. It’s not uncommon to see some customers with unrealistic expectations. I don’t hold those against the business. But what I spend more time looking at are the negative reviews. How a business responds to those situations tells me a lot about what it may be like working with them.

I get it. Nobody and no business is perfect. However, I want to know what company X will do for me if something goes wrong. These responses tell me if they genuinely care about their customers and the service they provide. This also tells me if they're willing to take advantage of their client or want to go the extra mile and make it right. What I'm getting at with all of this is that negative reviews are not that big of a deal. If you've been in business long enough, you will likely have more than a couple bad, and likely unfair, reviews.

Platforms like Google and TripAdvisor give more organic reach to companies who spend time responding because it shows they are engaged and care. They know any company who truly cares about their guest experience is likely, at the very least, an above average business. We will be diving more into this subject later in the book.

One of the services I provide for my clients in these digital marketing audits is offering engagement rates. It may sound elementary, and indeed it is. However, less than 5% of my clients take the time to determine what this metric entails. Establishing a baseline is crucial because as my strategy evolves and I begin to produce better content aligned with my audience, these rates should increase month over month and year over year. Additionally, it assists me in identifying the types of content that resonate most with my audience.

Believe it or not, I spend 30% of my audit time analyzing competitors. Looking over your shoulder is not what I’m suggesting. However, looking at competitors locally, regionally, and nationally is essential for the audit's purposes. And you should do it at least once a year. It's vital for many reasons, just as it is to audit yourself and your business.

One of the most straightforward reasons is for creative inspiration. So often, when examining other social media pages, you might find yourself thinking, "I like how brand X did this," or "I admire how brand Y did that." This process is helpful because even the most skilled individuals experience creative droughts where they struggle with what to post or talk about. By analyzing competitors, we can discover ideas and uncover creativity that adds confidence and motivation to our actions. It's also a great opportunity to compare ourselves in terms of quality, engagement rate, and consistency.

I want to talk about comparison for a quick moment. It's unhealthy to compare ourselves or our businesses to others, especially when comparing a small, locally-owned business to a Fortune 500 company. However, during an audit, it's not a comparison, as much as it is an opportunity to grade your performance against others and give yourself a competitive advantage. If nothing else, this will affirm that everything you're doing is spot-on. And for people like myself, it can serve as a swift kick in the butt to elevate our digital marketing game. Remember, it’s less about the other business and more about using this exercise to improve your brand and its marketing.

More importantly, the result here is a recommendation and an action plan. Whether paying someone to do it or doing it yourself, all of this information should eventually be integrated into the marketing strategy and content calendar. Remember that this is the foundation of your strategy. Without these steps, whatever you create as a plan, recipe, or content calendar will be nothing more than fluff that will be utterly hollow as it will all be arbitrary information that sounds good in your head and on paper.

It's important to note that this section is not a part of the strategy document. However, It's a task that should be completed annually.

Step #4 - What is Your Vision?

Part A

In the vast sea of digital marketing, with its myriad of channels and relentless waves of trends, having a lighthouse—or as I call it, a vision statement—ensures you don't get lost in the storm. Just as a captain sets sail with a destination in mind, marketers, too, must embark on their journey with a clear sense of direction.

In this chapter, I'll show you why having a crystal clear vision plays a pivotal role in shaping your marketing endeavors and how it can act as your compass in the unpredictable world of digital marketing.

Before we dive in, I must share a pretty interesting story. A couple of years ago, I met with a prospective client who was already wildly successful in business and certainly above average on social media. This individual had a podcast and a YouTube channel, generating nearly 1 million dollars annually. Technically, he had no issues with his business, revenue, or marketing. Sure, I could poke some holes into some of the things he was doing, but he was profitable and very successful at the end of the day. If he continued on the same path, he would see some steady success and live a sustainable life with his business.

However, like most hungry entrepreneurs, he wanted more. He had fantastic ideas about how he could grow and scale his company to help him generate new revenue streams. The only problem was that he was a solopreneur and did almost everything himself. This approach would undoubtedly lead to burnout, which could harm his business in the following year. So, we scheduled a discovery meeting where I assisted him in creating a vision. Our initial hours were dedicated to understanding the individual and his business.

Naturally, one of the first questions I asked was, “What is your vision?” The response was surprising. And it was as visual as anything. His face looked surprised as his head turned left to right and scanned the ceiling. If there was a six-second pause, it felt like two minutes. He began by mentioning things like wanting to increase his follower count, aiming for more downloads, and finding ways to generate additional revenue from sponsors. However, it seemed like he was coming up with these ideas on the spot. How could this be for someone who was already generating significant revenue and experiencing success? For many, this is as far as they can go without a clear vision and strategy. While one could argue that he's fortunate to have come this far without a crystal-clear vision and a robust strategy, it's evident that he has hit a ceiling. With a team and a solid strategy in place, that ceiling could potentially be ten times higher.

Think of a vision like a road map to a destination far away, but one you've been to before. It's a lot easier to navigate somewhere when you have that visual, when you know where you're going, and what that destination looks like. Without that vision, you ultimately drive aimlessly, hoping and praying that you're headed in the right direction.

Part B

Having a vision statement is imperative. I'm talking about something other than the one that matches your company's mission statement or core values. This would be a vision statement of what your business intends to do, specifically through your digital marketing strategy. And even more specifically, in the next 12 months.

At its core, a vision statement isn't just a sentence or two about the future. It's a crystallization of your aspirations, ambitions, and the impact you wish to make through your marketing efforts.

The problem with most vision statements is that they typically look out three, five, or even ten years into the future. However, the issue lies in the fact that marketing changes frequently. What works now may not work in a few years. The way we engage with our audience and the type of content we produce could evolve drastically in just a few months, let alone years. Moreover, you may not even be working for the same company in five years. Therefore, it's crucial to focus exclusively on the next six to 12 months. This is because we want to take massive action now. Concentrating on what could or might happen in three or five years is irrelevant, as a lot can change between now and then. Let's focus on the now.

I've also found that many businesses who haven't gone through the comprehensive digital marketing audit often struggle creating a vision statement. That’s because they truly don't know where they are in the digital marketing world. They lack visibility into how their marketing efforts are performing, whether they're aligned with overarching business goals and objectives, or how they compare within the industry. Frankly, too many businesses are siloed. Their departmental efforts, goals, and objectives are segregated. This leads to dysfunction, poor results, turnover, and wasted money.

When crafting a vision statement, it's more impactful if it’s short and sweet. Get something on paper and try to pair it down to two short paragraphs or even better, one. Remember, we can't be everything to everyone, and we certainly can't achieve everything in our first year, so let's raise the bar high, but not high enough to where we're going to fall short. Here's an example of what I came up with a little over a year ago.

Sample Vision Statement:

ABC Marketing will proactively leverage digital marketing platforms to drive business growth. We will create compelling and shareable content, foster authentic connections with our target audience, and establish ourselves as industry thought leaders. By engaging in strategic social media campaigns, implementing data-driven tactics, and leveraging emerging trends, we aim to increase brand awareness, drive website traffic, and generate qualified leads. With our dedicated monthly advertising budget and our commitment to social media improvement, we will position ourselves as a trusted authority and create opportunities for sustainable business expansion.

Feel free to poke holes in that vision statement. Yes, it's very generic, and it was created initially for a speaking engagement and then revised for this book. Still, it was a great excuse to take a generic statement and refine it into something more meaningful. For this to be truly effective, it should include some specific metrics in that statement. I’m referring to SMART goals. If you’re not familiar with that term, it will be discussed in the next chapter. Two things to note here: First, we're not looking for perfection; we just need to start taking action now. Second, this statement is designed for internal use only, so don’t be afraid to include revenue or profit figures.

When you're looking to craft your vision statement, it should resonate with and complement the foundational beliefs of your company. It should inspire action, and more than words, it should motivate and spur your marketing team toward a common goal. I also like it to be future focused. However, I don't want you painting a picture of what things will look like in five or ten years because, by that time, one-third of your company will have transitioned to a new job. On the flip side, this statement can inspire team members as it will provide a visual of what’s ahead in the coming months, guiding actions toward that horizon.

Whether you're a solopreneur, a small company, or a large company, there is precision when there is purpose. No assumptions or ambiguity exist when a crystal clear vision is documented and openly discussed. Whether choosing a platform or creating a campaign, each marketing decision becomes an intentional stride toward the envisioned future. As a byproduct, you get a unified effort that ensures that all marketing endeavors across all departments and teams align toward this single purpose.

We all know that digital marketing is notoriously volatile. Whether it's algorithmic changes, emerging platforms, a possible platform ban, or shifting user behaviors, a vision statement acts as the north star with these uncertainties. When faced with decisions or dilemmas, revisiting the vision will clarify and answer the why behind every action while keeping the ship on its intended path. It’s your lighthouse that provides direction when you lose direction.

Step #5 - Identify Your Target Customers (Personas)

Trying to appeal to everyone will result in appealing to no one. It's the same with marketing. Casting your net too wide means you might not catch anything. Sure, people might stumble upon your ad or website, but if you're shouting into the void without thinking of who you're trying to reach, nobody's going to feel that connection. And in today’s world, consumers want a specialist, not a generalist.

So, let's get down to business and figure out who you're talking to or should be talking to (I call it targeting).

Quick heads-up: Your target audience and your target market are akin to cousins, not twins. Your target market encompasses the broader category, such as small businesses, which is a broad category. Your target audience, however, comprises the specific individuals or groups within that market whom you're directing your marketing efforts towards.

Let's say you, a digital marketing coach like me, are focusing on small businesses. That's your target market. But dive deeper, and I’m really looking at solopreneurs, independent coaches, consultants, and authors. Those are my target audiences. I could get more granular, but for many of us, this exercise is more about identifying who we should be targeting.

It's pretty common to have a few different target audiences hanging out under the umbrella of your target market. And get this: you might even narrow it down to mini audiences for every campaign you're running.

A lot of times we know who we are targeting, but we may not have the demographics. In that case, a simple Google search can help to give you a better understanding of both the demographics and psychographics. You can also obtain a plethora of information on your current followers through the Facebook insights tab. This feature can tell you all about your followers age, location, gender, etc. However, there is no guarantee that more than half of your followers are even your ideal customer. It's more important to focus on your target audience.

Step #6 - Setting Goals

Suppose the vision statement provides the destination in our digital marketing journey. In that case, the goals are the milestones that guide us there. Setting clear, actionable goals is paramount in a dynamic and vast digital marketing landscape. In this chapter, I'll outline the significance of goal setting and introduce the SMART goals framework - a tried-and-true methodology ensuring our goals are not just dreams, but achievable realities.

As mentioned previously, the vast majority of goals are made up based on almost nothing at all. In other words, they are arbitrary. It’s almost like you’ve heard me say that before.

When goals are based on nothing more than assumptions and wants, the outputs become unfocused. The rest of the strategy becomes more and more meaningless. We're not even 40% into crafting our recipe, so if you choose to overlook this step, it will negatively cascade into everything else you do. In other words, everything you do from here on out may or may not serve a significant purpose or have meaningful impact.

When setting goals, it's essential to do research, as we discussed in the audit phase. Look at any historical data, which by the way, you get in just a few minutes. Look at past sales and benchmarks, subjectively and objectively, and ask yourself what are we capable of over the next quarter or several quarters in the current fiscal year. Sure, there are a lot of other data points to look at, but it all depends on what you're looking to achieve. Before we start discussing what goals are best, or what percentage you should want to grow by, let's talk about the SMART goal framework.

If you did your due diligence with your Google analytics back in the audit phase, you’d already have a benchmark for website performance and where you believe it should be with your new strategy.

With the SMART framework, each goal translates into a roadmap and leaves no questioning or uncertainty about what we want to achieve.

S - Specific: For example, instead of simply increasing website traffic, let's be specific and state something like increasing organic (non-paid) website traffic by 15%.

M - Measurable: Indicates precisely how you plan to measure the outcome. For example, we use Google Analytics and HootSuite to track weekly and monthly website traffic and bounce rates. These numbers will be reported and discussed at the monthly sales meeting.

A - Achievable: This assesses the performance, industry benchmarks, and available resources before setting the target. Ultimately, we're talking about how realistic this goal is. Or, in some cases, why we believe it’s realistic. For example, last year we averaged 1,200 website visitors per month to our website. With a newly optimized website, a more robust social media strategy, and a $300/mo Google advertising budget, we believe 1,800 per month is attainable.

R - Relevant: Believe it or not, not all goals are relevant. Let's ensure the goal ties back to the broader business objectives, precisely our vision. This could be lead generation, web traffic, email subscribers, or brand awareness. If you’re more of a startup, awareness is a great starting point. However, if your business is well known, your objectives might be more closely tied to lead generation. What’s relevant is what aligns with your top business objectives. If the company has a goal to expand into new markets, your goal or goals should include those initiatives in some capacity.

T - Time Bound: Finally, we want to set a clear deadline, preferably within the next quarter, and at most, the next 12 months. I prefer to keep things more within the next quarter as it applies enough pressure for us to move the needle forward continually.

When I work with my clients to create goals, one of the things that's really important is to identify three to five things you'd like to achieve in the next 12 months. Once you've done that, highlight the one you feel is most important to your business. Then, highlight the second, and third most important. You'll want to narrow it down to the top two if you have limited time, limited bandwidth, and a small or no team. It's about relevance and importance. Try to zoom past vanity metrics, like followers and engagement, and focus on what will help your business grow and thrive. While seven or eight goals might sound fantastic, we are only capable of so much at any given time. Rather than additional stress and burden, let's focus on two to three goals this quarter, knowing that these can constantly shift next quarter or next season. You can also add goals as your team, bandwidth, and resources expand.

Whether we're talking about the overall strategy or the goals within the plan, it's important to remember that digital marketing is as fluid as water. As such, when you create that strategy, don't write with an ink pen, but rather a pencil because your goals are subject to change. Suppose you actually use the plan and pay attention to the goals. In that case, you'll recognize that a few things will need to be revised and it could be one of your many goals. You'll also want to pay attention to industry trends and analytics to ensure your marketing efforts align with what's happening in your industry, what your consumers want, and where your business wants to go.

Just having goals isn't enough though. Even the most intelligent and robust goals require regular monitoring and group discussion within your company or leadership team. It's essential to create a feedback loop where you establish mechanisms to get feedback from teams, helping indicate potential challenges or changes early. Furthermore, remember to celebrate even the smallest of victories. Recognizing and celebrating when goals are achieved will foster a positive team culture and boost morale.

On the flip side, we’re bound to hit a few potholes during our journey. Even when we’re crushing it, something is bound not to work or fall short. Instead of seeing missed goals as failures, use them as learning opportunities to refine future strategies and tactics. Falling short of a goal could mean that you need to spend more time calculating. It could also mean that things have changed or user behaviors have shifted. There are many things we can control and many things we cannot. When you look at the numbers and the output isn't what you wanted, try to understand why. When you feel as though you found the answer, it's essential to make adjustments and pivot so that you can inch yourself closer to achieving the goal next quarter.

In the intricate maze of digital marketing, SMART goals act as the guiding light, ensuring every step is purposeful and aligned with broader business objectives. Marketers can navigate the complex digital landscape with clarity, focus, and confidence by breaking down the vision into tangible, actionable milestones. As you harness the power of SMART goals, remember that the journey of digital marketing is as much about the milestones achieved as it is about the learning and growth along the way.

Step #7 - Fill Your Buckets

I remember a conversation from my agency days with a client, an established family-owned business that had recently ventured into e-commerce and found success. While trying to explain how we build strategies, something came out of my mouth that I wasn't expecting. I said we need to put certain pieces of content into the talent acquisition bucket. The business owner looked at me cross-eyed and as a light bulb went off in my head, I smiled. I smiled because I knew I was on to something with this bucket thing.

In the strategy session, we established that their number one goal moving forward was talent acquisition and retention. They wanted to increase the number of applications they received by 15% or more. They wanted help specifically through social media and their website, not only to attract more talent, but also retain the talent they currently had. We knew that over the next three months, and likely throughout the year, they would need to hire five to six people.

This company was focused on maintaining its people-first culture. They didn't just want to hire anyone, they wanted to hire individuals that best matched their current workforce. Because of that, they had a big advantage. This company did a lot in the local community. They also did a lot for their employees outside of the primary benefits you might see on a job posting. They provided a lot of flexibility, numerous opportunities for promotions, and various other enticing benefits. Therefore, when discussing strategy, I had to remind them that we must keep the bigger picture in mind. Remember a few chapters back when I mentioned that we would revisit this concept? Well, here it is.

This is the perfect example of keeping the macro in mind. We looked out over the next quarter and every week we had at least two posts on their various social media platforms that were talent acquisition or retention specific. And I’m not talking about posting a job. We did this because, as I've mentioned, we wanted to be proactive, but also to ensure that their profiles had a pipeline of content supporting the narrative that they are a great place to work. We knew that hiring, talent retention, and culture were things they considered highly important, so we made sure it was on the top of their content hierarchy.

Some of you might be reading this and saying, “Chris, shouldn't they post more about their products and services?” Yes, you could make that argument, but that doesn't mean it's right or wrong. I might argue that this strategy is even better because what I'm about to tell you is probably something you've never heard of or thought about.

Let's transition back to the buckets for a moment. In this talent acquisition and retention bucket, we will add seven to ten pieces of content that support the goal. So, what goes into that bucket?

●        Employee video testimonials

●        Employee anniversary

●        Throwback Thursday (focus on company history)

●        Community sponsorships

●        Volunteering (with schools/nonprofits)

●        Team building events

●        Celebrating small victories

●        Awards

●        Thought leadership content

●        Environmental initiatives

●        Show you point of difference (pride, craftsmanship, innovation)

●        Showcase collaboration and fun (photo posts)

●        Share the metrics (average employee tenure)

If you stop and think about it, the list could go on and on. If it’s really important, you’ll get creative and you’ll keep adding ideas to that list or, in this case, to the bucket.

Content buckets represent relevant themes in a social media strategy that help an organization achieve their goals. Your goals and your buckets may change quarter to quarter. An organization should have no more than three to four content buckets or goals at a time. What goes in the content bucket? Various types of content (themes) help support that specific goal. Once you start filling your buckets, you may see some overlap as some pieces of content can support more than one bucket. As your strategy morphs quarter to quarter or semi-annually, look back at your audit and look at the stop, start, continue.  Look at the creative inspiration and ensure that your content and all of your digital efforts are driven by what works, by what your prospects want, and not just what you think is cool.

The goal is to fill the bucket to where it’s overflowing with creative, thought-provoking, and delightful content. More importantly, this content should support the fact that your organization is a special place to work.

Even if you fall 4% short of your goal you've also created some crossover adjacent goals. What I mean is some of this content also supports your general awareness bucket. It might even slightly flow into your customer acquisition bucket, especially if you're in the B2B space.

Below is a bucket system I set up for a general B2B manufacturing company.

You see, all of these pieces of content show that you care, and if it shows that you care about your people, how likely is it that you care about your customers? I don’t know about you, but I believe in the old saying, “Your employees are more valuable than your customers.” That's not to say that customers are not extremely important. As small to medium-sized business owners, if you take care of your employees and create an enjoyable work environment while rewarding them for their efforts, the outcome for each and every one of your customers will be positive. Employees who are well cared for will care about your customers just as much as you do. That's why this small business was so concerned with hiring and retaining the right people.

If we zoom out for a second, it's essential that your business has no more than two or three marketing goals at a time. Those content buckets should be directly aligned with the goals. And if I didn't say it already, your micro efforts are the things you're doing on a daily basis, such as your posts, engagement, direct messages, etc. Just remember that you can't have one without the other, and just having goals alone doesn't mean much of anything.

I want you to create a few buckets and identify what the priority is for the macro. Ensure that your micro efforts are focused exclusively on filling those buckets and getting them to overflow.

Step #8 - What Social Media Platforms Should I Be On?

This subject is overlooked a lot, and it's interesting for many reasons.
Growing up, my mom used to say, “You can't be everywhere at once.” This certainly holds true for marketing, especially on social media. If you're wondering why, it goes back to the conversation about bandwidth. Bandwidth is a frequent topic of discussion because it dictates much of our strategy, including where we should be, where we want to be, and what to expect.

Before I tell you how many platforms you should be on, or what platforms you should be active on, let's revisit the bandwidth conversation.

Most entrepreneurs I work with don't have the luxury of having a four-person marketing team or agency to do the work for them. They're lucky if they can muster two and a half hours per week to work on any sort of marketing. (This is 60% of the population, if not more.)

So, if this describes you, the question isn't which platforms I should be on. The question is how much bandwidth I have and where my prospective clients are. In some cases, it's essential to identify how many platforms you can manage. After all, what's the point of trying to be everywhere if your ideal client is only active on one or two social media platforms?

So, the first task is to create a list of social media profiles where you feel your current and prospective clients spend time. More importantly, where do you think they are accessible? What I mean by that is whether it's organic posting, direct messaging, or advertising, where can you get their attention?

Now, make a list of those platforms. It's likely to be a shorter list. I want you to rank them in order and circle the top three. From there, you should take a few minutes and look at your daily, weekly, and monthly schedules. Then, zoom out over the last year and ask yourself, not subjectively but objectively, how much time do I have weekly to manage my marketing. Managing three platforms or more will be challenging if you've answered two hours or less.

Let's switch gears for a moment. What would happen with those two hours per week if you tried to take on five social media platforms besides email marketing and customer support? Would your efforts be diluted? Would the quality of your output diminish? Would things potentially slip through the cracks? And if you answered yes to any of those, at what cost? What is the economic impact of making your marketing less effective when it’s already ineffective? What is the point of doing social media if it becomes even more ineffective? I’d argue it could be damaging to your brand.

What if what I'm recommending is what you’re currently doing, and it's not working? I'd have to assume that you fall somewhere into one of the ten excuse categories and that other items are missing from your marketing strategy, if you even have one. However, there is one piece of advice that I recommend. And that’s when things get stagnant or just stop working, it's time to pivot. In this case, it could be that you're investing time posting to a platform that has generated very little return on investment. For many, that platform is Twitter, now known as X. When that time comes, cutting bait and moving on is essential. Sure, there is opportunity on most platforms. But there are other platforms where there will be equally as much, if not greater, opportunity for your business to thrive.

Because we live in such an ever-changing social media landscape, you must look at and identify other platforms to help your business stand out. Suppose you're a restaurant that's been on Twitter (X) for five years, has 220 followers, but sees zero engagement on most posts. In that case, it's time to shift those efforts to another platform. That could mean moving to TikTok, YouTube, or even LinkedIn.

Ultimately, I tell people that by trying to be everywhere all the time, you end up being nothing to nobody. The more places you try to be, the more you dilute yourself and your efforts. And just imagine what that might look like to your prospects or even your competitors. I'll go as far as to say I would rather you take on only one social media platform and do it to the best of your ability.

The byproduct will be quality over quantity, with content that resonates so strongly with your audience and prospects that they'll actively seek out doing business with you.

If you're considering what platforms to be on, ask yourself first where your prospective clients are and then rank them in order. From there, identify how much time you have on a consistent, weekly basis to manage your social media. That amount of time should dictate the number of platforms, and for most small to even medium-sized businesses, trying to be on more than three platforms will be a challenge.

Step #9 - Set An Advertising Budget

For me, digital advertising is a non-negotiable. For others, it's a necessary evil. Many of you reading this book have a hard time understanding why an advertising strategy is necessary, especially when posting is free in the world of social media. The ability to post for free is a privilege, and it's something that we need to appreciate and stop taking for granted.

I remember back in 2007 when Facebook introduced business pages. It was a phenomenon that wasn't appreciated until a couple of years later. At that time, you could invite people to like your business page and also share that content on your personal profile. But even more significant was that their algorithm didn't prevent business pages from reaching their audience. In other words, the algorithm wasn’t robust enough to prioritize content from individuals instead of businesses. There's no way of knowing the exact organic reach, but many outlets report it was near 100%. This means that as a business page, all your followers would eventually see your post. As you fast forward to 2015, that number began to shrink drastically year over year, and now, as we write this book in the year 2024, organic reach is said to be as low as 5%. And, you're lucky if a high-performing post sees 10% organic reach. Yeah! That sucks, but at the end of the day, social media is still free, and it still allows you the opportunity to reach a massive audience.

So, where am I going with all of this? It's safe to say that organic reach on most social media platforms is practically dead. No, I'm not telling you not to post to any of these platforms. What I am suggesting is you pull back on the frequency at which you post and use some of that bandwidth and budget toward advertising. (Later on I’ll share other suggestions where you can invest that time and money.)

Over the last decade, we've seen more competition in the newsfeed with both organic posts and paid ads. That competition, specifically on the advertising side, will continue to rise as we see more and more large brands like Ford Motor Company, Coca-Cola, Doritos, Taco Bell, Red Bull, etc. Big brands are investing more in social media advertising because that’s where the attention is. It also provides a better return on investment than most traditional advertising verticals. The lesson is that even small businesses need to focus exclusively on where the attention is but, more specifically, where their ideal customer is.

I like digital advertising for many reasons, including:

●       You get to choose your exact demographics

●       You get to choose your ideal psychographics

(behaviors and interests)

●       There are dozens of different campaign types (ad formats)

●       Boosting a post is so easy almost anyone can do it

●       It's the only way to get your brand in front of new eyeballs

●       It's far more cost-effective than traditional advertising

●       As little as $20 a day can be impactful for small businesses

If you're considering jumping into digital advertising but aren't sure where to start, it's essential to consider the social media platforms where you're currently active, especially those that generate results. This is because advertising on a new platform where you have no following and no content might look suspicious to someone unfamiliar with your brand. Starting on a platform with a good following and some momentum makes sense.

If you're considering branching out onto Google, you have many options. But whether you are running ads on a search engine, a website, or a social media platform, it's essential to zoom out and think about where you intend to direct this traffic.

Not all ad campaigns are going to translate to more sales. A good ad will drive traffic, but only sometimes does that translate to conversions or sales. I'll give you a specific example.

Three years ago, I worked with a company that made high-end backpacks. They had recently completed a beautiful rebrand and a website facelift. From the outside looking in, everything was on-point. Their photography and graphic design were beautiful, the copy on the website was creative and thought-provoking, and even their pricing was reasonable for an American-made product. When we finally got to the point of running ads, we instantly had success driving traffic. That number continued to rise month after month. However, it didn't translate into as many sales as we expected. The rise in traffic should have resulted in 10-14% increase in sales. Instead, we were scratching our heads with a slim 2% increase. We saw this trend for a couple of weeks. Eventually one of our team members decided to go to the website and purchase a product. It wasn't because he wanted the item, he wanted to see what the customer experience was like.

When I heard the story in real-time, it was almost as if I could have predicted what he would say. It began with an explanation, like 'There's no way we're driving all this traffic, and it's not resulting in more sales; there's got to be more to it.” So, I went online and discovered that buying one of their products took me nearly five minutes. That's almost twice as long as it should take to buy a product online. As we started to dive into this user experience, we found that purchasing a product required everyone to create an account, which the majority of people don't want to do.

Furthermore, there was no option to check out as a guest, which would save us a lot of time. Other hurdles, such as confirming and verifying account status before purchasing was cumbersome. The purchase process also required us to open additional tabs in new browsers, which certainly would not make for an enjoyable experience from a mobile device. Simply put, this process required four or five more steps than I would have expected from purchasing something on Amazon. And, it required us to enter a lot more information. This left users frustrated and, as we found, resulted in a sky-high abandoned shopping carts. We later found out that over 60% of the people who put an item in their shopping cart did not purchase it. This number was south of 30% before they launched their new website.

After meeting with the client, we recommended they pause all ad spending until they could rectify the issue. The resolution was to make the checkout process as simple and easy as possible. I recognize that most small companies cannot do what Amazon does, but streamlining the process was sure to capture more sales from the people putting products in their shopping carts. Fast forward three months later, the company had streamlined its online buying process and, even before running ads, had found that they could cut the abandoned shopping cart percentage by 25%. Imagine the success of a high-performing website that offers great products paired with a killer ad campaign.

So, the question is, how much should you be spending? Your ad budget should be between three to four percent of your total revenue. I recommend always starting small and ratcheting that up as you build success. If you're new to running ads, you will likely see minimal success in your first or second ad campaign. Start with a five to seven day campaign and a small, yet reasonable ad spend. Your budget should be something that you're comfortable losing. Say $100.

If you see digital advertising as a journey and on that journey you document what's working and what's not, you’ll continually improve, generating more and more results and increasing your overall conversion rate.

The moral of the story is that wherever you're driving traffic, ensure that you're driving traffic to a landing page optimized for conversion. Not every page on your website makes sense for the user. Directing them to your homepage is only sometimes the best answer. You want to put them on a landing page that only requires them to do very little. Don’t assume they will read everything on your page, watch the video, or even give a damn about an award you won. Where you want to ideally send visitors is to a page that will get them closer to converting without having to do a lot of reading, clicking, or scrolling. In some cases, you may have to build a landing page designed with a lead magnet to capture contact information from prospects. Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all recommendation when determining where to direct website visitors.

Whatever page you send them to should have all the information they need and answer all their questions. Before you spend a lot of money, go through the buyer's journey or have someone do it and give you their feedback. Otherwise, you may be running ads blindly and simply hoping for results.

Step #10 - The Strategy Template

I remember how excited I was to start my first real business in 2017. As I previously mentioned, I spent nearly a year and a half preparing a strategy and business plan. I was so excited that I made a business plan almost 30 pages long. And what did I do with that strategy? I put it in a file cabinet attached to my desk and it collected dust for nearly nine months. Just thinking about that strategy was cumbersome. Looking at it felt time-consuming and stressful.

Fast forward a couple of years and I stumbled upon something that changed my career path and changed me as an entrepreneur. I was tasked with speaking at an event about social media strategy. However, I was informed that the audience was so new to the subject that I had to make it as elementary as possible; otherwise, I'd be speaking over their heads. Additionally, I needed to prepare a handout. It took me several days to think about how I would make this subject so simple. I stared at a blank page on my computer for several hours. I started with what I thought was the true foundation: the mission statement.

I included company voice because it's essential to identify the tone of your copy and content to ensure that you stay true to the brand your company has created and cultivated. Below are three goals with boxes to track them quarterly.  We also included a line for indicating the posting frequency or the number of times you post per week, along with a section for specifying a dedicated monthly advertising budget. Although it may seem elementary, I also had them write down the social media platforms they'd be posting on and the platforms they'd be willing to advertise on. Finally, there is a space to indicate what tools they would use for reporting purposes. Analytics and measuring are key to future success.

At the bottom of the document is a section for notes that can be used for observations, ideas, trends, or anything else. I ended up with something that I still use ten years later.

Over those ten years, I have yet to make a single revision to the document. It ended up being so basic and easy there's no excuse not to develop a strategy. In theory, you could fill it out thoroughly in under 20 minutes and end up with something that, at a bare minimum, could elevate your social media. Unfortunately, it's so elementary that it doesn't get the respect it deserves. It doesn't include everything that an experienced marketer might want. However, if you're new to digital marketing, this is the best possible resource. This will act as your north star and will be a daily reminder of where you're going and what you're doing.

Whether you use my template or create your own, you must focus on what is critical to you and your business. It's essential that you find a template that works for you and ensure that the template is no more than two pages. Even if you think you're an expert, three pages may begin to feel like a lot. As you go through the peaks and valleys of being extremely busy, you'll feel the burden of that large document and you'll continue to push it to the back burner and delay reviewing that information.

Step #11 - Implementation

The strategy document is only one of the important things here, and I want you to stop for a moment and think about that before you continue reading. I don't care who created the document, how long it is, or how much thought or data was put into the manuscript. It is entirely worthless and useless unless what is documented is implemented. I'm going to say that again because it's important. It's only useful if what is documented and suggested is what's implemented.

Like a restaurant, anybody can make a reservation, but holding the reservation is the most important thing. When I show up with my family at 6:00 p.m., I'd like to be seated and not have to wait 20 minutes. If I had wanted to wait 20 minutes, I wouldn't have made the reservation. Just like a strategy, I will have an implementation plan if I'm serious about achieving what's in the strategy. So, if you're scratching your head and wondering if this is a separate plan, the answer is no. However, it's crucial to outline how you will accomplish these tasks because merely writing them down doesn't make them happen. As I often advise my clients, you can't achieve a million dollars in revenue by merely hoping or wanting. Success comes from making changes and taking massive action. Your strategy should reflect this action coupled with ambition, without any unnecessary fluff.

You should remember that a strategy without an implementation plan will have zero value. In fact, it will all have been a massive waste of your time and potentially even a significant blow to your ego when things go downhill.

Now that I've jump-started your heart, let's talk about a few things. First, suppose this is really important to you. In that case, you must dedicate time to creating, measuring, and reporting on your weekly calendar. This could come in the form of 30-minute or 90-minute chunks of dedicated time. For me, I schedule at least two one-hour sessions every single week. I use the first session to batch create content in Canva or edit podcasts and record a few short form videos, i.e., Facebook reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok. I then use the second hour to respond to comments and DMs and engage with other creators I'm connected with or who are important to me. Once a month I take a half hour to review my social media. I use a tool called HootSuite. I can look at the data and insights to identify trends. I also look at what types of content are performing the best and which are not. Ultimately, I want to give my followers more of what they want. I dedicate at least two hours a week and about nine hours monthly. As I zoom out and look at my busy calendar, I realize that it's not a big deal to dedicate that amount of time. My social media has generated nearly three-quarters of my total revenue, so ensuring that I continually deliver high-quality content that speaks to my audience is very important to me to continue building my personal brand.

For those unfamiliar with Canva, it is a free web-based graphic design tool. It can be used to create graphics, edit videos, make logos, order business cards, and so much more. It is absolutely essential for any marketer and the only business tool I couldn’t live without. However, I recommend upgrading to the premium version.

It's essential to dedicate time and protect that time. When I'm trying to fit too many things into my schedule, and someone wants to meet during one of my marketing blocks, I have to decline politely. And I get it. Nobody wants to reschedule a meeting two weeks or more into the future. However, it's essential to remind yourself that if something is truly important, you must hold and protect that block of time. What happens if you decide to postpone it just once? You're likely to repeat that behavior in the near future, gradually eroding your commitment to preserving that time. Soon, you'll find yourself making excuses like “I can't find the time” or “I'm too busy.” In reality, you'll only find time if you make time.

I want to revisit a time when I joined a country club almost ten years ago. I have many friends who to this day have more flexibility with their jobs than I do. We would often talk about wanting to play more golf, and by the way, we still do. But I finally realized I'd never find the time. My schedule always seems full of coaching youth sports, nonprofit board responsibilities, cooking dinner, fantasy football, and helping kids with homework. You get the point. I recognized that playing more golf would only happen if I made time. In other words, making time by sacrificing something else. That could be choosing to work through my lunch or deciding to take fewer breaks in the day. But more importantly, it means saying no to more things. I'm saying no to additional volunteer opportunities, sales meetings, or taking on projects I don’t have the capacity for. Looking back, I’ve been trying to fit more meetings in a day than I should.

Playing more golf also comes back to me needing to delegate more to my team and finding a virtual assistant to help with daily tasks that I shouldn't be doing. By taking that burden off my shoulders, I can do things that I genuinely enjoy, like recording podcasts and playing more golf; these things fill my cup so that I can fill the cup of others.

On the subject of self care, I find it really important to be selfish sometimes because I believe that when you are selfish, it allows you to be more selfless, just like the previous example I shared. In my job, I provide a lot to my clients and give a lot of energy to the people I work with because I genuinely love what I do. Still, I also need to take care of myself so that I can continue to be the best version of myself—for my own sake, for my family, and for my clients.

Protecting your time is crucial in this regard. If, like me, you choose to carve out time—such as waking up at 6:00 a.m. for a 30-minute workout—you'll find yourself with more time for other pursuits. Yet, we all have the same 24 hours in a day; it's how we choose to utilize that time that makes the difference in achieving our goals. If something is truly important to you, it deserves a place on your calendar. By prioritizing and safeguarding that time, you ensure it gets done. This principle is fundamental to effective marketing strategies.

Content Calendar

When speaking at conferences or talking with clients, I’m often surprised by how many people operate with a content calendar. One could argue that this is better than nothing, but I could say it’s still a waste of time unless it’s powered by a robust strategy.

Content calendars have many benefits. However, it’s important to remember that it's merely one component of many in your overarching marketing strategy. Its most significant benefit comes as your consistency and accountability partner.

If you're new to this subject, a content calendar is a digital tool. It could be a platform like Hootsuite, Sprout Social, monday.com, Asana, and hundreds of similar tools exist. It could also be as simple as an Excel spreadsheet. It's a monthly calendar showing the visual content you plan to post to your social media platforms, including the copy, time of day, the call to action, and anything relevant to your posts. It could also include your podcast or blog posts.

Those who religiously use a content calendar tend to batch their content. Specifically, they'll spend a couple of hours creating all the content they need once a month. Then, they spend time inputting it into the calendar and scheduling posts so their social media is somewhat automated. While I'm not a big fan of the set-it-and-forget-it theory in marketing, semi-automation allows you to take that burden off your shoulders and focus on more significant projects throughout the week. It takes social media from a daily task to something you oversee weekly. In other words, rather than being in the weeds daily, you can now focus on the overall management of your marketing and save time. You can thank me for that later.

For a content calendar to be effective, you have to have a good handle on a daily, weekly, and monthly schedule. As mentioned in one of the previous chapters, content calendars work well when you can block time once a week or a few times a month to batch content, measure, report, and engage. Rather than scrambling to develop a post idea every other day, with a content calendar, you can operate at a higher level of efficiency.

The benefits of content calendars are significant on many levels. For the average person, they help maintain consistency and keep you on track. But for businesses operating in a fast-paced environment where unexpected opportunities arise, they become invaluable. With a content calendar, you can easily adapt and fill in the gaps as needed. For instance, if your company is featured in a local magazine or interviewed by a news station, you can seamlessly slot that post into your schedule without disrupting your overall social media strategy. This flexibility allows you to capitalize on opportunities without sacrificing consistency or coherence in your marketing efforts.

Your team will appreciate that a content calendar allows your colleagues to step in seamlessly if somebody gets sick or you're on vacation. It also helps you prepare for seasonality. (Even if you’re not in retail, all our businesses have seasons, peaks, and valleys.)

One of the aspects I value most about using tools like HootSuite or Sprout Social is how they streamline the process of reviewing and reporting analytics. Instead of navigating through multiple platforms with varying idiosyncrasies and potentially inconsistent data points, these tools aggregate the necessary information in just a few minutes. This efficiency not only saves time but also ensures a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of social media performance.

So rather than going the old-fashioned route of posting the same thing on four different platforms, a content calendar or social media management platform can save you several hours a week and even more time on an annual basis.

Step #12 - Elevator Pitch (Positioning Statement)

An elevator pitch and positioning statement are slightly different at the macro level. On the one hand, you have a positioning statement that should explain what a company does and how it differs from its competitors. It is often focused externally as it is intended for the target customer. Positioning alone typically refers to how you compare in the competitive environment. So often, a comparison to or reference to a competitor is not uncommon. The most important part is the final sentence where you must identify how the product, company, or service is differentiated. And for your company to sound even remotely interesting, you must be creative and possibly bold. This is something that even big companies struggle with at times.

For those of you considering cutting corners by relying solely on your tagline, think again. Taglines typically aren't comprehensive enough to serve as a complete position statement. They often fall short in fully conveying what your company does, how it differs from competitors, or how it solves customers' problems. However, a well-crafted tagline can and should align with your overall positioning strategy. In fact, it could even be seen as a spin-off or subset of that statement.

The term elevator pitch originates from someone's ability to tell a stranger in an elevator what their company does before the doors open. Ideally, we're talking 60 seconds or less. By today’s standards, it’s 30 seconds or less. A good elevator pitch is also externally focused and often explains what the company or individual does. What most people forget is that it should be used both in one-on-one conversations and also in various forms of marketing.

The first problem is that, having visited thousands of websites and social media profiles, I'm often left disappointed by how companies position themselves—or sometimes choose not to. They're often too busy focusing on themselves rather than putting the customer in the center of the story. In other words, the business is too focused on what it does rather than how it helps customers or solves a problem. (The problem could also be the pain point.)

The second problem is that so many positioning statements are focused on boring corporate speak. In other words, they talk in general terms. Rather than trying to tell me what they do in the simplest terms, they use jargon and make claims like, "The easiest CRM software" or "CRM for small businesses" rather than focusing on the issues and pain points the small businesses struggle with.

The third problem is that they are too busy comparing themselves. For example, many businesses refer to themselves as best-in-class or better than the competition. Unfortunately, most consumers couldn’t care less about what you think about your business. Most consumers would expect you to say things like that. You must realize that deciding who is best-in-class is not up to you. It's up to the consumer and they develop that opinion after the purchase. So, I often train my clients on what I call the good, better, and best philosophy.

Good, Better, Best Philosophy

Yeah, I said it. You don't get to choose who is the best. The consumer gets to decide who's the best and who they want to hire to fix their leaky sink. But, what is going to convince that buyer to choose your company? Stop and think about that for a moment. It has very little to do with what you think about your company. It has a lot more to do with two things. First, I would likely choose a company over its competitors based on social proof. This would include positive reviews on platforms like Google and Facebook. If I felt like I could potentially trust and hire you, I'd go to your website and do some of my own research. The first thing I should see is your positioning statement. You've already lost my interest if it says something about how you are best-in-class or better than the competition. I hope that you are the best-in-class. Given that most plumbers offer similar services, what sets you apart? I'm interested in what you're promising because simply claiming to be “better” doesn't convince me. If all you're saying is that you're slightly better than the rest, you're essentially a commodity. That approach suggests, “Sure, we're like everyone else, but we do things a bit better.” Frankly, that's not convincing. I want to know how you or your business differ from your competition. If you position yourself as a slightly better commodity. The truth is, you're not. FYI, unless you've won an industry award from a credible organization, you don't get to use labels like "best-in-class."

I often tell my clients that good is average, better is good, and different is best. I'm going to say that again because it's imperative. Good is average, better is good, and different is best.

If you are the best-in-class, don't say it; show it. Show me hundreds of testimonials of past clients who raved about the service they experienced. If you have hundreds of happy clients, showing me shouldn’t be a problem.

On that note, what is the one thread they loved or the one narrative in those reviews that sets you apart from your competitors? Was it a timely service? Was it the cleanliness of your facility or friendliness of your staff, or the no hidden fees thing? Ultimately, when I hire a service provider I expect them to solve the problem.

What do I want? I want them to be timely. I'd expect they would clean up after themselves, and I'd hope they would charge me a fair rate. We all know that type of service is hard to come by, but what promise are you making to your prospective customers? Today, just suggesting that you offer 24/7 service is not a difference maker. Saying your staff shows up on time is not a big enough difference maker. But making a bold claim such as, "Service in 24-hours or it's free," or "We won't keep you waiting" are extensive guarantees. Still, people will pay a premium if the expectation is that they don't have to wait, and that is something that most competitors are not willing to compete with.

These claims or guarantees are interesting, creative, bold, and unique. You are no longer a complete commodity when you are different.

Side note - don’t go out of your way to promise something you cannot deliver.

To develop an effective elevator pitch or positioning statement, it's crucial to assess what the competition is doing. Spend an hour or two reviewing ten to twelve thriving businesses in your industry. Make sure to include a mix of local, regional, and national companies.

Put the business's name, location, positioning statement, and guarantees into a spreadsheet. Then compare what you found to what you're offering. What jumps out to you? What claims or statements help to build trust and authority? Are there consistent questions and pain points your clients are asking, and if so, do any of these statements address those? Once you've done this, you'll have the intelligence to adjust your positioning statements in a way that resonates with your prospects. And yes, I said statements, meaning your business should have at least two or three variations you intend to deliver to the marketplace. These statements could be based on your services and around the needs and wants of your target customers.

Different positioning statements are essential because not all phrases, taglines, or messages will resonate with your prospects. Furthermore, three variations distributed throughout your website can serve as different reminders or ways of reinforcing your point of difference. This is something the vast majority of small to medium-sized businesses need to do.

What is your position in the marketplace? If you're reading this and scratching your head, the answer I want to hear should be something other than some boring corporate speak or that you are better than or voted the best. Tell me how you're different or how you solve my problem. Make a creative or bold claim that your business can back up. Consider something that is thought-provoking, or even better, question-provoking. If you need a gentle reminder, read my story about how I struggled for years, introduce myself and talk about my business. The goal here is to stand out in a sea of sameness.

Positioning Statements

Suppose you are a leader in your business or even some kind of coach, consultant, or speaker. In this case, you need a personal brand, which we will talk about in the second half of the book. A positioning statement isn't just for your business. It can also be about you. That is why it's helpful to have two to three statements you can use, given the context or situation. For example, if I'm at a networking event, I want to talk about myself and my company. This is essential, especially in a sales role, because people are more interested in hearing about how you can help them. Moreover, if you can demonstrate care, passion, or empathy for your clients' challenges, you can quickly build trust and authority.

Referring to your experience with said product or service can create demand. As a byproduct, people will want to engage, hoping you can answer their questions or solve their problems. In the case of a positioning statement, I often refer to myself, the service I'm selling, and my company. As an entrepreneur, that's easy because I am all those things. It may seem more challenging for those working in a larger corporate environment. However, remember that sales is mostly based on relationships. Relationships are based on communication, trust, compassion, reciprocation, and a variety of similar components. I argue that passion and knowledge can be a part of that. But ultimately, it's imperative to know what your prospects want. It is also critical to understand the issues they're trying to solve or, as they're known, pain points.

But like everything in this book, positioning statements must be simple and easy. As you already know, that also means concise. I have a history of making things too long because I thought back in my 20’s it would be more impressive. As I realized and grew older, I came to see that more text only muddies the water and increases the probability of a spelling error. So, after going through dozens of variations, this is what I landed on for a positioning statement, and I still use it to this day.

Hi! My name is Chris Burns. I am a digital marketing coach who helps medium to small-size businesses. My goal is to strategically make marketing so easy it's fun again, so easy you'll have no excuses. I help my clients master their marketing and start generating leads in 90-days or less.

Crafting a creative positioning statement is exceptionally important for me in my industry. There are tens of thousands of marketing professionals and consultants who claim to do exactly what I do. Because the consumer can only sometimes differentiate a marketing consultant from a social media consultant, I have a few variations of that statement I can use.

Because I’m competing locally, nationally, or even internationally, I have a lot of competition so I need to do something nobody else is doing… DIFFERENTIATE!

I recognize that 75% of my clientele, or more, are at least 40 years of age or older. Furthermore, those 50 years of age and older, easily get frustrated by the idea of social media. And I get it; it's an evolving industry that changes daily. Keeping up with trends is challenging, let alone posting consistently. And with organic reach declining, it feels like it's not working anymore. Even if I were to attempt to demystify social media marketing, that alone isn't enough.

Some podcasts, newsletters, and books already claim to make marketing easy. I've talked to thousands of business owners in my career and recognized that they're looking for a few things. First, they want to understand, or in other words, be educated. Second, they want it to be easy. Most are sick of the jargon and the complex strategies that never seem to work. Third, they want transparency and trust. I've heard from many businesses that have hired an agency or freelancer only to be disappointed by the lack of transparency, missed deadlines, poor communication, and lack of results.

While other things are essential to my clients, these three big things stand out. Yeah! It's a lot, and I can't tackle all those objections with a positioning statement. However, I can tackle all three, and possibly more, with an intentional positioning statement, a thoughtful mission statement, core values, and if the social media content I create can convey how and why I’m different.

I know I can’t achieve all of that in one post or possibly in a week. However, if I am focused on my position in the marketplace and my clients' pain points, my followers and my prospects will quickly understand that I’m not just another marketing consultant.

What is most important is that the message conveys who you are, what you do, who you serve, and why you're different. For many of you, there's a lot more you want to say, so it's essential to have two or three variations of these statements, but please, keep it short.

To craft your statement, begin by jotting down two or three key benefits your brand provides to its customers; anything beyond that becomes white noise. Think in terms of what you do, who you serve, and your unique advantages. Remember, referring to the size or weight of a widget is a feature, not a benefit. While offering free shipping or competitive pricing is common, they are not true differentiators. Similarly, having ten years of experience or being passionate about your industry is admirable, but it doesn't inherently solve a problem or position your company as unique or special.

As a reminder, these statements should be creative, thought-provoking, and, more importantly, question-provoking. You'll struggle to rise above the noise if you can't check the boxes on all three things. And if you can't make yourself or your company sound interesting, why would I want to set up a meeting with you, let alone buy your product or service?

Positioning is fundamental and foundational in marketing. It will or should cascade into every product you launch, every piece of content or blog we write, the ad campaigns, and even be discussed at your next sales meetings. In many ways, it’s an identification card.

Without a solid positioning statement, buyers will position you as they see fit, which is generally in the wrong place. So, If you skip this step or fall into the trap of mediocrity, your marketing and your business will struggle in perpetuity.

Step #13 - Listening and Engagement

I often find that many businesses, both in conversations and online, fall short when it comes to listening and engagement. This aspect is crucial because platforms tend to reward business profiles that actively engage with their followers. Every comment, even if it originates from the business itself, contributes to increased engagement. However, many companies opt for a "post and ghost" strategy, neglecting the interactive aspect of social media.

If you're reading this book, you've likely been guilty of it at least a few times, I know I have. It's where your sole focus is creating and posting content to generate an ROI. Outside of posting, little to no action is happening on social media. In other words, your social media is a one-way street that leads to a boring and miserable dead end. That one-way street is you talking exclusively at your followers, not listening, not asking questions, and not engaging with them. Just you hoping and praying for some crazy reason that maybe the platforms will show your content to more people, more of them will engage, follow, and eventually buy your products. That my friends is a terrible strategy, or what I would call a plan that leads you to the cul-de-sac of misery. This is why so many small businesses eventually give up on social media and walk away. If that’s the case, don’t blame the social media platforms for a lack of results,

The comparison I like to make is to networking. Imagine attending a big business conference or a local chamber of commerce event. You are there for the purpose of networking and meeting people. Using a version of the post and ghost strategy would be where you walk around, talk to 15 people and tell them about your business. Rather than reciprocate by listening, asking questions, and attempting to help or cultivate a relationship, you walk away before they can talk or give you their business card. Just imagine for a moment doing that. How many phone calls would you expect to receive? I guarantee you'll never receive a phone call. Furthermore, you will have simultaneously damaged your reputation. If you do that more than once, people will start talking, and you'll eventually get removed from the group. A similar result on social media would be the platform issuing a shadow bin. In other words, the platform sees your spammy tactics and lack of effort and will likely show your content to no one. Even if this doesn't happen, continuing this behavior will lead to many people not following or unfollowing your profile.

What most are missing is that engagement is reciprocal. It's the same with the energy and attitude you bring to the office or home to your family daily. If you greet people with positivity and enthusiasm, they do it for you and they may do it for others. When you ask questions and listen, people tend to do the same. It's a behavior, but it's also a sign of respect. And as a professional in this industry, I am determined to put the social back in social media. This is a part of the business that has frustrated me for a long time. I struggle to understand why so many are focused on the media, yet still do a lousy job at it.

Many think you're focused on the social part, but it's the talking at people rather than conversing with your followers. Even so, there's another element that's also missing, and that is cultivating relationships.

Cultivating a relationship at a networking event is not likely. However, if you frequent that networking event three or more times, you build warmth with those individuals. Eventually, over nine months to a year, you develop a level of friendship and trust. At this point, those individuals understand who you are and the business or service you offer. When they eventually have a need, they will want to purchase from you so long as you have added value to the networking or social media experience. But as anything, building trust and accumulating a large audience takes months, if not years.

Regarding listening and engagement, I invest about 20% of my marketing time in this category. For some businesses, it could be more; for others, it could be slightly less. But it's important because I want to be thoughtful about my responses. You want to keep those conversations going and create meaningful relationships, eventually leading to more referrals and business. If you believe that’s true, it just requires a little thought, care, and compassion.

This listening thing is easy. Now, platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn will notify you when your brand or business page is mentioned. Why wouldn't you want to be a part of that conversation when it happens? Whether feedback is negative or positive, it's crucial to demonstrate that you care. Now, I understand your hesitation. You might be thinking, "But Chris, why would I want to engage with a negative comment about my brand?" However, not engaging could be perceived as indifference. Many of you may be risk-averse, much like I used to be, or as my wife would say, conflict-avoidant. Yet, I've witnessed several clients effectively address hostile or negative reviews and turn them into positive outcomes. Conversely, I've seen businesses ignore a few negative reviews, only for the issue to escalate. I relish the challenge of turning negatives into positives because many believe it's impossible. Moreover, the potential impact on your business can be significant. In fact, I have a story about how a local restaurant accomplished this a couple of years ago.

Growing up, there was a bar in town that must have changed ownership seven different times by the time I graduated from college. The various owners tried to reinvent the wheel, but ultimately, every business that tried to establish itself failed. You originally thought it was just a bad location, but it wasn't. It was located nearly a block from a country club and a half block from a nice hospital. It was a quarter mile from downtown and in a great neighborhood. However, I would argue this was just another bar. Like most, they did little to nothing to differentiate themselves. Why would I go there when I have dozens of options, even in a small town?

A year later, a gastropub came in, renovated, and claimed to have one of the area's largest selections of craft beer. At the time, they also had a unique menu and some of the best food in town. These two big differentiators helped them succeed in a cursed location. Because of its failed history, people were excited to go and give it a try.

I remember working for an agency and trying to bring them on board as clients. They told me that after three years, they started receiving a handful of negative reviews that, in hindsight, felt a bit unfair. I did some research and these reviews all had a consistent theme: the restaurant didn't have any gluten-free or vegan options. Many assumed these options would be available for what seemed like a high-quality restaurant with a unique menu. In 2016, most restaurants in this area didn't offer these types of menu items. However, the issue was that they did offer gluten-free and vegan options, but it wasn't explicitly stated on the menu. Specifically, this information could only be found in the fine print in the bottom right-hand corner, and let's be honest, most of us are too lazy to read the fine print. After asking several questions, I discovered that their customers didn't want to go out of their way to ask for a gluten-free bun or for something to be vegan.

Some felt they were inconveniencing the server by asking to make something special for them. The business owner and I had several conversations and we eventually brought them on as a client. As part of my advisory, I suggested that when they introduce their next menu, they more specifically dedicate a section and explicitly state that these items are made to be gluten-free and/or vegan. In this situation, nobody would feel like they're inconveniencing anyone and nobody would be made to feel special or potentially self-conscious about ordering one of these items.

Shockingly, I got a call from the owner one day, and he said they'd had some conversations with their staff. Internally, they felt it was a great idea. He seemed not only bought in but also excited about the potential. It seemed as though his staff helped him see the demand and opportunity that was ahead. More specifically, he said this would be an opportunity to differentiate, which, as you can imagine, was music to my ears. As the conversation blossomed, he asked me how to promote this and what to do next. My first suggestion was to craft some messages for their vegan and gluten free customers. The purpose is to convey that we understand the customers' frustrations and want an opportunity to serve them again. Tell them about the new menu and the gluten free and vegan options. I then suggested his marketing person go back to TripAdvisor, Yelp, and Facebook and if possible, re-engage with everyone who commented about gluten-free or vegan options.

I knew that wouldn't be enough to move the needle, if at all. I suggested they invite them back for a free drink, appetizer, or a discount on their bill. Furthermore, tell these customers that you want feedback. Specifically, from the gluten-free and vegan community and that their feedback was important. Obviously, it took several weeks for their only marketing person to sift through several emails, voicemails, online reviews and comments. Once this was all complete, the client let us know at one of our monthly meetings. After about 10 days, he called and asked me what to do. I said, hurry up and wait.

As the weeks went by, he started to see a few responses, some inquiries, and even a few phone calls asking about the new gluten-free and vegan options on the menu. It was a pleasant surprise because the restaurant owner wasn't expecting much of anything as he was unaware of how big this customer segment had grown.

As the weeks turned into months, they started to see a small snowball effect. These menu options were becoming increasingly popular, but it didn’t have much to do with their marketing. It was mostly due to word of mouth, which had a lot to do with their effort to connect with all of their vegan and gluten free clients they messaged directly the month before.

While I saw some of this coming, neither of us truly understood the magnitude of what was possible here. I say that because I am not part of this community. I was unaware of the various Facebook groups, chat rooms, websites, blogs, newsletters, etc., discussing these health trends and diets.

We both learned that this isn't a trend or just a diet; it's as much a lifestyle and a form of health as anything else. And, people in these communities talk. They don't talk to badmouth or trash businesses that don't cater to the gluten-free and vegan crowd. They talk and promote the companies who do. When one of these individuals finds a restaurant with several dedicated options on their menu and makes an effort to prioritize that and makes them feel comfortable and welcomed, they tend to support and advocate for these businesses. By advocating, word of mouth spreads, and it spreads fast. So much to the point that gluten-free and vegan entrees comprised nearly 20% of their total business. Before, it was less than 5%. While this might not seem astronomical, it was a big deal, especially to the bottom line. I say that because these weren't just regular people already going there to eat. These were people who wanted to dine there because of their menu. The restaurant became a destination.

As I zoom out on this story, they were thinking and feeling no different than I would have been. They needed to be fully educated on the magnitude of this demographic. However, they were, like many of us, slightly risk-averse. They were offended by negative reviews, and I get that. They also didn't see the opportunity to turn a few negatives into a big positive. And that is where we need to take the time to allow ourselves to be creative. I do this often by immersing myself in the data points. I read reviews to understand what my customers and competitors want. What are their pain points, and is it possible for me to provide those while still being efficient and profitable? It's not always easy, and many of us are so busy that it feels like we have blinders on. But that is why it's also vital for us to lean on our team and ask others for feedback. So often, the input we should listen to is from our current and prospective clients.

Again, I want to stress how easy this is. Taking as little as five minutes a week to read reviews, comments, and DMs isn’t a big ask. You can do it while waiting for your next meeting or during a commercial break of your favorite sporting event. What's more important is looking and reading for a common thread and not being quick to dismiss something as being a fad or invalid. What you do with that information is more critical. In this situation, five to ten minutes a week over three months turned into what was approximated to be nearly $250,000 in additional annual revenue. For many businesses, that extra revenue can help you afford new technology, more equipment, and potentially that sought-after family vacation you've wanted to take.
